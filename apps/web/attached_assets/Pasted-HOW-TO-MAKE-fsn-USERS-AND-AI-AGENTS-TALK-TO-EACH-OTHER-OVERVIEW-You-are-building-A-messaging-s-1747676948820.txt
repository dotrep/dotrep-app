HOW TO MAKE .fsn USERS AND AI AGENTS TALK TO EACH OTHER
🟩 OVERVIEW
You are building:

A messaging system between users like jason.fsn and alice.fsn

AI agents with .fsn usernames like ghost.fsn or core.fsn that respond to messages automatically

A way to earn XP, trigger quests, and unlock stuff

You already own:
✅ The domain: fsnvault.com (good job)

Do exactly what this says.
Don’t skip anything.
Don’t get cute.
Just follow the damn steps.

🧱 STEP 1: USER DATABASE
Create a file or database called users.json or users.db.

Each user should look like this:

👤 Human User
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "fsn_name": "jason.fsn",
  "user_type": "human",
  "email_alias": "jason.fsn@fsnvault.com",
  "vault_id": "vault_001",
  "messages": [],
  "xp": 0,
  "inventory": []
}
🤖 AI Agent User
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "fsn_name": "ghost.fsn",
  "user_type": "ai_agent",
  "email_alias": "ghost.fsn@fsnvault.com",
  "agent_script": "ghost-agent.js",
  "vault_id": null,
  "messages": [],
  "xp": 0,
  "inventory": []
}
💡 Every .fsn name must be unique
If someone tries to register with ghost.fsn, reject them

🧑‍💻 STEP 2: MESSAGE SENDING FORM
Build a simple web form with:

Input: To: (the user types ghost.fsn or alice.fsn)

Input: Message: (they type anything like "hi", "yes", or "help")

Button: Send

📦 STEP 3: MESSAGE HANDLING LOGIC
When the user clicks "Send":

✅ Look up the recipient by fsn_name

✅ If recipient is a human:

Store the message in that person’s .messages array

✅ If recipient is an AI agent:

Load the script listed in agent_script

Run the function handleMessage(sender, message)

Save the reply as a new message from the agent back to the user

🧠 STEP 4: GHOST AGENT SCRIPT (copy exactly)
Create this file: ghost-agent.js
Put this in it:

js
Copy
Edit
module.exports = {
  handleMessage: function(sender, message) {
    const m = message.toLowerCase();

    if (m.includes("hi") || m.includes("hello")) {
      return "👻 Boo. You found me. Want a challenge?";
    }

    if (m.includes("yes")) {
      // Grant XP
      addXP(sender, 25);
      return "Decrypt this: RnJlZVNwYWNlIEtleQ==";
    }

    return "Ghost fades away into the code...";
  }
};
Also add this somewhere in your main code:

js
Copy
Edit
function addXP(fsn_name, points) {
  const user = users.find(u => u.fsn_name === fsn_name);
  if (user) {
    user.xp = (user.xp || 0) + points;
  }
}
💌 STEP 5: STORE MESSAGES CORRECTLY
When a message is sent, store it like this:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "from": "jason.fsn",
  "to": "ghost.fsn",
  "message": "hi",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-19T22:00Z"
}
When the agent replies, store this:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "from": "ghost.fsn",
  "to": "jason.fsn",
  "message": "👻 Boo. You found me. Want a challenge?",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-19T22:00Z"
}
All messages must go into the recipient’s .messages array.

📬 STEP 6: SHOW INBOX
On the dashboard, build a view that shows:

All messages to or from the logged-in user

Include:

From

Message

Timestamp

Sort by newest at the top.

📈 STEP 7: XP & INVENTORY (OPTIONAL BUT BADASS)
Every time a user gets XP, update their profile:

json
Copy
Edit
"xp": 75
If they earn gear, update:

json
Copy
Edit
"inventory": ["starter_skin", "vault_patch"]
Later, you can have agents give skins, files, rewards, NFTs, etc.

✅ LIST OF AI AGENTS TO ADD
Name	Handle	Role
core.fsn	core-agent.js	Central AI that gives onboarding & quests
ghost.fsn	ghost-agent.js	Secret drops, XP, riddles, puzzles
vault.fsn	vault-agent.js	XP tracker + gear manager
forge.fsn	forge-agent.js	Skin/item creation + cosmetic upgrades
echo.fsn	echo-agent.js	Journaling, history, past actions

Just copy the ghost-agent.js format for others.

✅ CHECKLIST (DO NOT MARK COMPLETE UNTIL IT’S TRUE)
 You created a user table with .fsn names

 Users can send messages to other users and agents

 Agent scripts respond based on the message

 XP is tracked and updated

 You show an inbox with messages + timestamps

 You NEVER show raw emails in the interface (only .fsn names)

 You added ghost.fsn and confirmed it replies with something creepy and fun
