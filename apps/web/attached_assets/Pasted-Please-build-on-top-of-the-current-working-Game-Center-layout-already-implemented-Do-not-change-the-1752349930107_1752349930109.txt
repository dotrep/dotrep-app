Please build on top of the current working Game Center layout already implemented. Do not change the existing design. Add the following elements incrementally:

1. Add a floating quest box on right side of screen
Position a new glowing cyan box on the right side of the screen.

Header text: DAILY VAULT UPLOAD

Body text: Upload a file to your Vault to earn XP.

Add a glowing button below labeled: PLAY QUEST

This button should be the only clickable element for now.

Use the same visual styling (font, glow, border, etc.) as the existing Game Center screen.

2. Trigger coin animation on button click
When the user clicks the PLAY QUEST button:

Animate a glowing XP coin that appears above the arcade cabinet.

The coin should:

Glow with the FSN logo (glyph) in the center.

Start by floating above the machine, then:

Flip and fly down smoothly into the coin slot at the bottom of the arcade.

You can simulate this with CSS @keyframes, or use an MP4/WebM animation file.

The animation does not need to trigger any XP deduction or reward yet ‚Äî just the visual.

3. Coin Design (if needed)
If you need a placeholder for the coin:

Use a glowing cyan circle with white FSN logo in the center.

Apply a subtle flicker/pulse effect to simulate energy.

Size: ~64x64px, z-index above all content.

INSTRUCTION END

‚úÖ Part 2: FSN Game Center Philosophy
You're right ‚Äî vault upload quests don't belong in the Game Center. They belong in the Pulse-based XP quest loop on the homepage or XP dashboard.

‚úÖ Game Center = Mini Skill Games
Should focus on playing fun, skill-based games like your Chinese Star/Ninja game

Outcome: XP (if legal), badge unlocks, maybe limited-time NFTs

‚öñÔ∏è Part 3: LEGAL ANALYSIS ‚Äî XP Rewards from Skill-Based Games
‚úÖ SCENARIO A: XP Rewards (NO Token)
Allowed if:

XP is not purchasable

There is no monetary prize or ability to cash out

XP functions like loyalty points (Starbucks stars, Reddit karma)

Users earn XP from gameplay alone, not from staking, buying, or wagering

üü¢ Conclusion: If XP is locked within the FSN ecosystem and not tradable, it's safe to reward XP for skill-based games ‚Äî including your ninja thrower.

‚ö†Ô∏è SCENARIO B: XP Rewards + FSN Token (Convertible)
If XP can eventually convert into FSN tokens, then:

You must prove the game is skill-based, not chance-based

XP accrual must not create a path to passive profit

Token conversion must be:

Manual (e.g., user must claim or choose to convert)

Not automatic or guaranteed

Time-gated, randomized, or capped

Regulatory red flags (GAMBLING/SEC concerns) appear if:

Game is luck-based (random drops, dice rolls)

Rewards can be cashed out (token ‚Üî ETH/fiat)

Users can ‚Äúpay to play‚Äù and hope to win

üü° Conclusion: You can reward XP for skill-based games, even if XP eventually converts into FSN tokens, as long as:

The game is provably skill-based

No buy-in exists

You make it clear that XP ‚Üí token is not guaranteed or predictable

‚úÖ Best Practice
If you want to future-proof legally:

Tie game rewards to badges, NFTs, and seasonal leaderboard streaks

Reward XP only after completing a threshold of skillful actions, not every round

Limit how much XP a user can earn per day or per season from games
