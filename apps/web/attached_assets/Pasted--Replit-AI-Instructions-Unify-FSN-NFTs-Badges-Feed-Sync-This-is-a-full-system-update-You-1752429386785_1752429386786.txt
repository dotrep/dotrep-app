üõ†Ô∏è Replit AI Instructions: Unify FSN NFTs + Badges + Feed Sync
üìå This is a full-system update. You are building a unified, on-brand, data-driven, and interactive badge/NFT layer across FSN's Social and Vault views.

üß© 1. Unify NFTs and Badges Under One System
Goal: All badges should be treated as NFTs, with real metadata, stored and displayed consistently across the platform.

Instructions:

Define all badges as NFTs with the following metadata format:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "type": "badge",
  "name": "Core Signal",
  "id": "badge_core_signal",
  "rarity": "epic",
  "description": "Awarded for reaching Core Signal level.",
  "earnedFrom": "Signal",
  "dateEarned": "2025-07-13",
  "xpBonus": 100,
  "visual": "/assets/badges/core-signal.svg",
  "soulbound": true
}
Store these badge-NFTs in the same vault/NFT registry used in the Vault ‚Üí Data Manager screen.

In the Vault > NFTs view, show all NFTs, including those of type "badge".

In the Social tab > Badges, filter only NFTs of type badge.

Ensure newly earned badges are automatically added to the user‚Äôs NFT list and show up both in Vault and Social tab.

üîÑ 2. Auto-Sync Badges with User Actions (Pulse, XP, Game Center, etc.)
Goal: Badges earned from quests, XP streaks, Signal unlocks, or onboarding should appear instantly.

Instructions:

Add backend logic or client-side triggers that:

Detect badge-earning conditions (e.g. Signal Level ‚â• 2, 7-day login streak, completed onboarding)

Mint or activate the corresponding NFT badge (from metadata registry)

Store it in the user‚Äôs vault

Refresh Social > Badges grid to include the new badge

Example triggers:

js
Copy
Edit
if (user.signalLevel === 2 && !user.hasBadge("badge_core_signal")) {
  mintBadge("badge_core_signal");
}
üé® 3. Redesign Badge UI (Visual & UX Fixes)
Goal: Remove placeholder art and unify badge design to match FSN's futuristic aesthetic.

Instructions:

Replace all white-background badge icons with SVGs or PNGs using dark themes + neon accent colors.

Use badge icon containers that are:

Circular or glowing capsule shapes

Neon border glow (cyan, violet, orange based on badge type)

Embossed or gradient-fill black backgrounds

Add optional rarity ring:

Common = no ring

Rare = thin glow ring

Epic = double glow pulse

Legendary = animated border pulse

Add hover effect:

css
Copy
Edit
.badge:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px #00f0ff88;
  cursor: pointer;
}
üß† 4. Add Interactive Badge Details
Goal: Clicking a badge opens a detail modal.

Instructions:

When any badge is clicked, open a modal showing:

Badge name + icon

Description

How it was earned

Rarity

XP reward (if any)

Date earned

Source system: (Pulse, Game Center, Trust, etc.)

Add optional buttons:

Equip Badge (for social flair or effects)

View on Chain (if relevant)

Share Badge (link or image)

üîó 5. Link Social Feed + Badges
Goal: When an event in the Social Feed results in a badge, clicking the feed item shows the badge.

Instructions:

If a feed item includes a badge-earning event:

Append + badge or icon in feed preview (e.g. ‚Äúüéñ earned: Core Signal‚Äù)

On click, AI panel explains badge + offers to view it

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "eventType": "SIGNAL_UNLOCK",
  "user": "satoshi.fsn",
  "timestamp": "2m ago",
  "xp": 50,
  "badge": "badge_core_signal"
}
Allow AI panel or direct click to open that badge‚Äôs modal view.

‚úÖ 6. Clean Up Vault NFTs
Goal: Make Vault NFTs view feel as polished as the Social tab.

Instructions:

Align NFT tile layout (e.g. border radius, neon hover)

Show NFT type icon in top-right (e.g. Badge, Collectible, Beacon)

Add filter tabs: All | Badges | Signal | Collectibles | Storage

Add earned date + rarity indicator in footer

Optional: allow pinning favorite NFTs

üí° Bonus (optional)
If user has earned multiple of the same badge (e.g. seasonal quest streaks), show it like:

üß© Hex Map Fragment (3 collected)
Hover shows progress: 3 of 6 for full Beacon Map
