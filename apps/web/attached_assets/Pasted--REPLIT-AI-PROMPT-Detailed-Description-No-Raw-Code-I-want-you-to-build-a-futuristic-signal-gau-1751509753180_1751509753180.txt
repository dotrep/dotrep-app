🔧 REPLIT AI PROMPT (Detailed Description – No Raw Code)
I want you to build a futuristic signal gauge interface that matches this design:

🌀 GENERAL DESIGN OVERVIEW

The component is a neon-styled analog signal meter with a glowing outer dial, a floating yellow needle, a digital readout, and a “SIGNAL” label.

The style is inspired by retro-futuristic interfaces — think TRON or cyberpunk tech.

The whole module is centered inside a square container and sits on a dark navy background. Use glowing cyan and yellow elements to match the uploaded design.

🎯 CORE ELEMENTS TO BUILD

Outer Gauge Arc

A large semicircle from 0 to 16.

Evenly spaced tick marks with glowing cyan numbers in increasing order.

These numbers should form an arc across the top of the dial, just like in the image.

Yellow Signal Needle

A single thin yellow needle, glowing softly.

The needle starts at the center bottom and points outward toward the arc.

It should point to a random number between 0 and 16, updating every few seconds.

Do not let the needle touch the internal readout or dip inward — it should hover only between the center and outer gauge.

The needle should not be sharp or jagged — make it rounded and smooth like a compass arrow.

Center Display Readout

A rounded rectangle display with neon blue glow showing the signal number (e.g. “9.5”).

The number updates along with the needle.

The units should be MHz, glowing slightly and readable.

It must be centered below the needle and in the same font/color as the image.

Decorative Dial (Bottom Center)

Below the readout, include a stylized dial circle — no interactivity needed, just visual.

Use concentric rings or a sci-fi-styled knob (see image) — make sure it’s centered and subtle.

Label: SIGNAL

Below the dial, include the glowing word “SIGNAL” in all caps.

Use the same sci-fi neon font — preferably Orbitron or something similar.

Slight glow and spacing between letters.

Visual Polish

Everything should glow subtly — use cyan and yellow accents.

Use dark gradients for the background: deep navy or blue-black.

Add a bit of depth using shadows or gradients on the gauge arc and display areas.

⚙️ FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR

Every 3 seconds, the yellow needle should smoothly rotate to a new random position between 0 and 16.

The MHz readout should update to match the needle's value (use 1 decimal place).

All animation must be smooth (ease-in-out rotation).

Use canvas or SVG to render the dial and needle (your choice).

📦 LAYOUT INSTRUCTIONS

This signal gauge module will eventually sit in the middle of a 3-panel layout:

Left: PULSE (circular dial)

Center: SIGNAL (this gauge)

Right: BEACON (bar chart)

For now, focus only on the signal meter, but make sure the layout allows for future side modules.

Make it responsive and centered in the browser.

🧪 EXAMPLE TEST SCENARIO

When the page loads, it shows the gauge at 9.5 MHz with the yellow needle pointing to 9.5.

After 3 seconds, it animates smoothly to another random position (e.g. 5.2 MHz).

Every few seconds, it updates again — like a fluctuating signal reader.

🧠 Summary for Replit AI:

Build a neon signal gauge that looks and behaves exactly like the final image I provided. It must:

Show numbers from 0 to 16 in a half-circle arc

Include a glowing yellow compass-like needle

Update every few seconds to a random MHz value

Display that value below the needle

Use futuristic visuals — glowing cyan, smooth lines, and a dark theme
