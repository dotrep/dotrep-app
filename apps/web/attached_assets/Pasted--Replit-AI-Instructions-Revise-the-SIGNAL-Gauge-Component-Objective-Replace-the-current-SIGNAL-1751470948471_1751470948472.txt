üõ†Ô∏è Replit AI Instructions ‚Äî Revise the SIGNAL Gauge Component
Objective:
Replace the current SIGNAL component on the FreeSpace Network homepage with a high-fidelity, fully legible, retro-futuristic tuning dial interface that precisely mirrors the visual style of the reference image provided (signal_dial_reference.png) while integrating seamlessly into the dark neon sci-fi UI of the site.

üîß Component Overview
You are building an interactive SVG-based component that matches the exact design aesthetics of the attached reference gauge (neon-glow, retro-futurism, clear readability) but also meets modern UX expectations:

Purpose: This is a crypto-native "SIGNAL" gauge, used as a symbolic frequency tuner for the user's .fsn identity status. It's part of a 3-dial system: Pulse, Signal, and Beacon.

Platform: This will be deployed on a responsive web interface in a <div id="signal-dial"> container.

Design Match: All design must match the attached reference (signal_dial_reference.png), but with corrected dial numbers and real-time interactivity.

‚úÖ Required Features and Behaviors
üéØ 1. DIAL STRUCTURE & VISUALS
The dial must be a semi-circular arc spanning from left to right (180 degrees), with:

Outer arc: large frequency numbers from 5 to 16 in whole numbers (5, 6, 7, ..., 16)

Inner arc: finer markings between numbers (e.g. 5.5, 6.5, etc.), labeled numerically with smaller font. Inner arc should mirror the example.

Tick marks: show both minor and major tick marks for realism (like an analog radio).

Use cyan-blue neon glow lines on a black background, like a Tron interface.

All fonts and indicators must glow softly, be readable at small sizes, and not overlap.

üéØ 2. DIGITAL FREQUENCY DISPLAY
In the center of the dial, include a rectangular box (like in the reference) with a glowing blue display that reads the current frequency as a float (e.g., 9.5).

Style the text to be legible and retro-futuristic, but avoid weird scifi fonts. Use a square, readable typeface with fixed-width digits (suggest: Orbitron, Share Tech Mono, or DS-Digital).

üéØ 3. RED NEEDLE
A thin red triangular needle (just like the reference image) should rotate along the arc to point at the current frequency.

Needle origin point should be centered below the arc, from the middle of the knob.

It must animate smoothly when updated.

üéØ 4. KNOB INTERACTION
Below the arc, there should be a rotary-style knob (as per the reference image).

The knob should:

Visually match the design in the reference (chunky, concentric rings, glowing dots).

Emit ambient glow but NOT look overly metallic or polished ‚Äî keep the old-school sci-fi feel.

Be draggable (desktop) or touch-sensitive (mobile) to rotate.

Synchronize with the needle's rotation and frequency display in real time.

Use a mouse/touch drag event to simulate turning the knob.

üìê Number Calibration Requirements
Here‚Äôs the exact scale and layout you must follow for the dial:

Outer arc: 5 to 16 (whole numbers), with 1.0 unit spacing.

Inner arc: show .5 markers between each main number (e.g., 5.5, 6.5, 7.5...), optionally up to one decimal point.

Markings must follow a real analog arc (angle-calculated, not grid-placed).

Ensure consistent spacing and no overlapping of labels. No truncated digits.

üß© Integration Notes
The new dial must fully replace the current SIGNAL component shown in fsn_home.png.

It must scale well with the rest of the UI grid (roughly same size as the Pulse meter).

All components (needle, dial text, knob, display) must be centered and symmetrical.

Embed it using React or raw HTML/CSS/JS, and ensure it can render as a standalone SVG/CSS component.

üß™ Testing and Fallbacks
Test at viewport widths from 320px to 1440px for responsiveness.

Fallback state: default to frequency 9.5 on load.

Do NOT use canvas for this ‚Äî use SVG + CSS animations so it's lightweight and CSS-accessible.

üîç Final Proof of Compliance
You will know the instructions were followed when:

The SIGNAL dial exactly matches the example in aesthetics.

The arc reads frequencies from 5.0 to 16.0 with inner decimals and visible tick marks.

Turning the knob smoothly updates the needle and the displayed frequency in sync.

The new dial fits seamlessly inside the existing homepage layout without distortion.

‚úÖ Proof: When rendered, the SIGNAL dial must be visually identical in style to the reference image and display a functioning analog-style tuning system with real, sequentially increasing, non-overlapping numbers.
