üïπÔ∏è LEFT CABINET: Daily Quest
Primary Structure:
Body: A vertical rectangular prism (cuboid) forms the base. The sides and back appear flush and uniform, providing structural depth.

Perspective: The cabinet is rendered in 3-point perspective with vanishing points pulling backward, downward, and to the right. This creates the illusion of depth and tilt.

Base footprint: Slight trapezoidal taper visible in the footprint ‚Äî the bottom is marginally wider than the top, giving a stable ‚Äúplanted‚Äù feel.

Control Panel Area:
The control surface projects outward as a slanted trapezoidal prism, tilted upward ~30‚Äì40¬∞, resting on a short extruded ledge.

Features circular disk-like buttons‚Äîgeometric cylinders in perspective ‚Äî and a subtle horizontal slot (possibly for interaction or light effect).

Monitor Bezel and Screen:
The screen housing is a recessed trapezoidal inset within a slanted parallelepiped (a skewed prism).

The top section leans forward and upward, suggesting an angular polygonal cowl.

The screen surface is curved with a convex ‚ÄúCRT‚Äù feel, but geometrically it's a slightly warped plane.

Marquee Header:
Titled "DAILY QUEST", it occupies a horizontally extruded cuboid, but skewed slightly upward ‚Äî visually a parallelogram extruded into depth.

Marquee faces frontward but cants slightly forward ~10¬∞, giving it a billboard-like effect on a tilted frame.

Facial Features:
The face (smiley with eyes and mouth) is rendered as ellipses and an arc, embedded on the screen plane, glowing with uniform radial gradients to simulate curvature and emotion.

‚≠ê RIGHT CABINET: Mini Missions ‚Äì Network Wars
Primary Structure:
Also based on a vertical rectangular prism, but this cabinet tilts more aggressively backward ‚Äî giving it a more dynamic Z-profile silhouette.

The right edge is more sharply angled, suggesting a deeper cantilevered control area and steeper monitor incline.

Control Panel Area:
Projects outward with a longer trapezoidal face, extruded to form a trapezoidal prism extending forward.

Houses two circular cylindrical buttons, aligned slightly closer to the user.

Button layout implies a ‚Äúdual control‚Äù or secondary interaction mechanism.

Monitor Bezel and Screen:
More angular than the Daily Quest version ‚Äî the inset screen is a concave trapezoidal recess (geometrically: a trapezoid extruded into a slightly negative depth).

The star-shaped face uses a centered pentagonal radial symmetry, resembling a 2.5D embossed polygon glowing from behind.

Marquee Header:
The "MINI MISSIONS" text sits in a horizontally skewed cuboid, more aggressively canted forward than on the left cabinet.

The top appears angled ~20‚Äì25¬∞ from vertical, giving a slightly overhanging effect.

The header geometry suggests a forward-leaning parallelepiped‚Äîcontributing to the cabinet‚Äôs aerodynamic ‚Äúlean-in‚Äù vibe.

Shared Geometric Themes and 3D Nature:
Perspective and Depth:
Both cabinets use a consistent oblique projection to simulate 3D, with:

Width depth shrinking toward the right.

Height lines angling slightly inward to converge visually.

Illumination creating rim lighting that emphasizes edge geometry and depth contours.

Base & Shadows:
Each cabinet casts a radial glow at the base, simulating contact with the ‚Äúfloor plane‚Äù and anchoring them in 3D space.

These glows trace the bottom profile of each cabinet, matching the geometric footprint‚Äîelongated trapezoid or rectangle depending on tilt.

Neon Outlines:
The glowing outlines act like wireframe models, reinforcing the geometry:

Edges glow brighter than flat surfaces.

Rounded corners are interpolated via B√©zier curves (curved edge segments between straight-line planes).

Stylistic 3D Cues:
No ambient occlusion or surface texture ‚Äî everything is read through shape, outline, and glow, giving it a clean, synthetic TRON-style vectorized aesthetic.

Despite minimalist shading, the 3D illusion is strong due to perspective lines, consistent vanishing point logic, and geometric layering.

TL;DR:
The left cabinet (Daily Quest) is a friendlier, upright trapezoidal-cuboid hybrid, whereas the right cabinet (Mini Missions) is more dynamic, aggressively angled, and forward-leaning. Both are constructed from extruded polygonal prisms ‚Äî mainly rectangles, trapezoids, and parallelograms ‚Äî and stylized with 3D-emulating neon geometry using glow, perspective, and precise contouring.
