✅ XP POPUP SYSTEM — FULL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE (DESCRIPTIVE)
👀 WHAT WE’RE BUILDING
We want to let users click the XP counter on the top-right of the Home page, which will open a glowing modal popup that displays:

Their total XP

Their current level

A glowing XP progress bar

Their XP boost based on Pulse Hz

A short log of recent XP events

A close button to dismiss the modal

🔧 HIGH-LEVEL BEHAVIOR
This modal only appears on the Home page

Clicking the XP counter (e.g., “325 XP” in the top-right) should trigger it

The modal should overlay the full screen, be dark-glass styled, and centered

XP boost and level logic are calculated from props/state (not hardcoded)

🧠 WHAT FILES TO CREATE OR MODIFY
1. 📁 Create: src/components/XPModal.jsx
This is a React modal component

It should accept the following props:

xp (total XP, e.g., 2350)

level (e.g., 4)

xpToNext (XP needed for next level, e.g., 3050)

xpBoost (percentage, e.g., 15)

recentLogs (array of XP events)

onClose (function to close modal)

2. 📁 Create: src/components/XPModal.css
This CSS file styles the XP modal

Key elements:

A dark glass overlay

A glowing, Tron-style popup card

An XP progress bar

A styled close button

3. ✏️ Modify: src/pages/Home.jsx (or wherever Pulse/Signal/Beacon are rendered)
In this file:

Locate the XP counter element (top-right of page — shows 325 XP)

Wrap this element in a <div> or <button> and add an onClick handler to show the modal

Add a React useState variable:

showXPModal — true/false toggle for displaying the modal

When the modal is visible:

Render the <XPModal /> component and pass mock XP values (or real ones if available)

4. 📁 (Optional) Modify: XPContext.jsx or XPProvider (if you're using a global XP system)
If you're storing user XP in context or Firebase:

Pull that value into Home.jsx so the modal displays live XP

Same for XP logs and pulse-based XP boost

🧪 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
After implementation:

Run the app and go to the Home page

Click the “325 XP” in the top-right

A modal should fade in and show XP stats

Click “×” to close the modal

🎨 BONUS UI BEHAVIOR
XP bar animates from 0% → progress (use width: ${xpPercentage}%)

Hovering over XP boost should show:

“Pulse: 82Hz → +15% XP earned”

Modal glows in neon blue (or cyan) with soft shadow
