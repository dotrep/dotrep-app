You are modifying an existing FSN Social Page UI that currently has:

A wide, multi-column layout.

A full-width constellation background.

A scrollable activity feed with timestamps.

A horizontally spread metrics section under the Core Signal icon.

Action buttons placed vertically on the right.

Your task is to transform this existing structure into a compact, vertically stacked layout with simplified elements, reduced scrolling, and no timeline timestamps ‚Äî while preserving existing components where possible.

1Ô∏è‚É£ GLOBAL LAYOUT ADJUSTMENT
Modify the main container:

Change from multi-column to single-column.

Set the maximum width of the main container to 440px.

Use margin: 0 auto to center horizontally.

Use flexbox to center vertically: display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; min-height: 100vh;.

Remove any horizontal grid or multi-column structures.

2Ô∏è‚É£ CORE SIGNAL ICON
Do not replace the icon ‚Äî keep existing Core Signal icon and structure fully intact.

Scale the Core Signal block down by approximately 10% from its current size to better fit the narrower layout.

Leave it horizontally centered at the top of the main container.

Retain pulse lock and glyph as-is.

Do not add or remove text above or below the icon at this stage.

3Ô∏è‚É£ METRICS SECTION
Locate the section where Followers, Following, Signal, and XP metrics are displayed.

Modify this section from horizontal row to vertical stack:

Use flex-direction: column.

Stack the metrics in this exact order:

125 Followers

47 Following

C3GAL Core Signal

2,350 XP

Apply the following style rules to each row:

Text center-aligned.

Font-weight: 600 for the numeric values.

Font-weight: 500 for the label text.

Font-size: 18px.

Line-height: 22px.

Vertical margin between each metric row: 10px.

Remove any extra padding or horizontal spacing previously used for the old row format.

4Ô∏è‚É£ ACTIVITY FEED MODIFICATION
Locate the existing social activity feed code.

Completely remove the following:

Timeline scroll bar.

Timestamps (e.g. "2m", "5m", "1h", etc).

Vertical timeline lines or dividers.

Any scroll-related functions or event listeners.

Replace dynamic timestamp display with a static vertical list limited to 7 recent events.

Use this static content for now (replace current feed data):

Edit
satoshi.fsn unlocked Signal  
cryptoai.fsn reached Sentinel!  
vitalik.fsn completed a quest  
0xghost.fsn is now following you  
jonny.fsn linked a new NFT!  
alethra.fsn unlocked Signal  
aldega.fsn unlocked Signal
Apply the following formatting for each feed item:

Username (.fsn) in bold: font-weight: 600; color: #FFFFFF;.

Event text: font-weight: 400; color: #AAAAAA;.

Font-size: 16px.

Line-height: 20px.

Vertical spacing between feed items: 12px.

Entire text block left-aligned inside the container.

No additional icons, unless already present for events like "unlocked Signal" (where üîì may be preserved).

Ensure no vertical or horizontal scroll bars remain.

5Ô∏è‚É£ CONSTELLATION BACKGROUND ADJUSTMENT
Locate the current constellation background component or canvas layer.

Modify as follows:

Limit the constellation effect to only cover the upper portion directly behind the Core Signal icon.

Reduce node density by approximately 70%.

Decrease brightness of star nodes by 80%.

Set line opacity to 0.2 or equivalent faint line rendering.

Do not extend constellation behind the feed or button areas.

Completely remove wide network grid effect behind full page.

Ensure background remains static ‚Äî no movement, animation, or interactivity.

6Ô∏è‚É£ ACTION BUTTON STACK (LIVE / CHAT / FEATURED NFT)
Do not replace existing buttons ‚Äî modify positions and sizing.

Move the existing button stack slightly to tightly align with the right edge of the new narrow container.

Maintain vertical order:

LIVE

CHAT

FEATURED NFT

Apply updated sizing for each button:

Width: 120px

Height: 50px

Border-radius: 10px

Vertical margin between buttons: 15px

Font-size: 16px

Font-weight: 500

Background colors: keep existing theme palette.

Apply soft neon glow: box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3);.

For the FEATURED NFT button specifically:

Keep the flame icon.

Apply a subtle outer glow to the flame.

Round the square shape: border-radius: 15px.

Apply flame shadow: box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(255, 140, 0, 0.4);.

7Ô∏è‚É£ TYPOGRAPHY UNIFICATION
Review and standardize font usage globally:

Font-family: FSN system font.

Default font-weight for body text: 400.

Headings and metrics: 600.

Subheadings: 500.

Font-size default: 16px.

Line-height default: 20px.

Primary text color: #FFFFFF.

Secondary text color: #AAAAAA.

8Ô∏è‚É£ COLOR PALETTE & GLOW EFFECTS
Maintain dark background: #0A0B10.

Slightly increase Core Signal glow brightness by 15%.

Apply consistent soft glow effect to all buttons to match FSN visual identity.

Use warm orange glow and slight inner glow on flame icon for Featured NFT.

9Ô∏è‚É£ RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
Verify that the entire layout properly scales for devices as small as 360px wide.

No horizontal scrolling should ever occur at any screen size.

The activity feed should always be limited to the 7 hardcoded items with no scrolling or dynamic loading.

Core Signal icon, metrics, feed, and button stack should all shrink proportionally on smaller screens.

10Ô∏è‚É£ CODE CLEANUP
Remove all unused timeline and scrolling logic.

Remove timestamp generation functions.

Remove scroll event listeners tied to the feed.

Simplify code to static layout using vertical flexbox containers.

Retain only the following main containers:

Core Signal section.

Metrics block.

Activity feed list.

Action button stack.

‚úÖ FINAL RULES

Do not invent or introduce any new elements.

Do not optimize the design beyond what is written.

Execute each modification step precisely.

End result must visually match the more compact design layout.
