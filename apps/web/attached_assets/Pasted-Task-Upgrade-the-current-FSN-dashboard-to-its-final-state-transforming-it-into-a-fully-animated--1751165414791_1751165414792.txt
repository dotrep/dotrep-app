Task: Upgrade the current FSN dashboard to its final state — transforming it into a fully animated, Tron-styled Trust Engine cockpit with Pulse, Signal, and Beacon indicators, active feedback, and recovery flows — all while preserving your existing nav layout and live data.

🔧 STRUCTURE: MAINTAIN THESE
✅ Do not change or remove:

Top nav bar (Home, Vault, Social, Game Center)

.fsn name

XP count

XP in last 7 days

The logic for Pulse, Signal, and Beacon gating

The “Next Action” recommendation box

🧠 SYSTEMS TO FINALIZE
1. 🫀 PULSE GAUGE
Replace the current flat Pulse score (50/70) with a circular animated gauge or glowing ring meter

The ring glows brighter as the Pulse gets stronger

Below 60 = dimmed ring (grayish flicker effect)

Tooltip on hover:

“Pulse is your identity’s health. Stay active to keep it strong.”

Add animation when Pulse changes
Example: If Pulse increases, the ring flashes briefly in cyan or teal

2. 📡 SIGNAL BAR
Replace current text (“10/100”) with a dynamic horizontal meter

Cap the fill to the Pulse level

Add a glowing effect that brightens at higher trust

Tooltip on hover:

“Signal reflects your behavioral trust. It’s capped by your Pulse.”

Bonus: When capped, show a faint glow around the bar with label:

“CAPPED”

3. 🛰️ BEACON PANEL
Convert Beacon section to a modular console-like card

State logic:

If locked: show 🔒 icon and a pulsing ring behind it

If warming up (Pulse ≥ 70 but Signal < 80):
Show radar animation with tooltip:

“Your Beacon is warming up. Boost your Signal to activate.”

If unlocked: Beacon console glows and reads ONLINE, shows a subtle pulse animation

4. ✨ XP DISPLAY & PROGRESSION
Keep current XP number

Add a glowing progress bar showing XP earned toward next milestone (can be based on weekly goal or static level threshold, like “500 XP”)

Tooltip:

“XP unlocks Vault skins, quests, and token access.”

Bonus: When user earns XP, flash an animation on this bar

5. ✅ NEXT ACTION BLOCK
Keep the logic for “Next Action” but add:

A small icon (📌 or ⚙️) for clarity

Background glow that increases subtly when user is doing well

Success feedback:

If last action was completed, show green checkmark or pulse ring flash

🖥️ UI POLISH / ANIMATION
Element	Add
Pulse Ring	Glow gradient fill + dim/flicker < 60
Signal Meter	Animate fill, throttle highlight if capped
Beacon Console	Locked = gray flicker; Warming = pulsing radar; Unlocked = glowing ONLINE
XP Progress	Animate on gain
“Next Action” Box	Brighten when fulfilled, change copy when satisfied
Identity Incentivized	Pulse outward slowly as background animation
Background	Maintain Tron-style gridlines — animate subtle particle drift or node pulsing if possible

⚙️ INTERACTION BEHAVIOR
Situation	Visual Response
Pulse increases	Ring glows for 1.5s, emits faint wave
Signal increases	Bar fill slides upward, tooltip updates
XP earned	Progress bar flashes
User becomes Beacon-eligible	Show modal or toast:

“🔓 Your Beacon is now online. You’ve unlocked global trust projection.”
| User reactivates after drop | Show “Welcome Back” toast + Pulse flicker restabilizing |

📱 RESPONSIVENESS
Stack gauges vertically on mobile

Ensure nav remains sticky

Show only relevant scores with collapsed details for XP or Signal on small screens

🚫 DO NOT
Remove or hide the nav bar

Change how XP or Pulse is stored

Display only raw numbers — visual feedback must lead

✨ OPTIONAL (Post-MVP Enhancements)
Add tabs below XP to view:

“Pulse History” (last 30 days)

“Signal Sources” (how XP/quests affected it)

Add hoverable sparkline charts

Add radar-style “Trust Map” animation when Beacon is unlocked

✅ END RESULT:
A live cockpit that makes users feel like their crypto identity is breathing — growing stronger as they engage, dimming if they stop, and broadcasting proudly when they earn it.
