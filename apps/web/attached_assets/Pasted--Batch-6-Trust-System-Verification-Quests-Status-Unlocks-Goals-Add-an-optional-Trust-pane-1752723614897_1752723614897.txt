🛡️ Batch 6: Trust System + Verification Quests + Status Unlocks
🎯 Goals
Add an optional Trust panel for identity verification

Gate specific features or quests behind verification

Reward verified users with XP, badges, and enhanced Signal

Use this to simulate the future KYC/AML + governance unlock path

✅ 1. Add Trust Panel (TrustPanel.jsx)
This is a new panel (like Vault, Pulse, etc.) that opens when you click the shield icon (🛡️).

Panel Shows:
What Trust is:

“Verification lets you unlock higher tiers of FSN — including enhanced Signal, governance tools, and staking boosts. You remain pseudonymous, but trusted.”

Progress Status:

Requirement	Status
Add recovery email	✅ or 🔲
Enable 2FA (Google Auth)	✅ or 🔲
Complete Profile Info	✅ or 🔲
Identity check (mock)	✅ or 🔲

Reward:

“🏅 Verified Status Unlocked: +100 XP, Trust Badge, Signal Core Amplified”

✅ 2. Create Trust Status in userProgress
js
Copy
Edit
userProgress.trust = {
  verified: false,
  requirements: {
    emailAdded: true,
    twoFactor: false,
    profileFilled: true,
    idVerified: false
  },
  xpRewarded: false
};
✅ 3. Add Trust Badge + XP + Signal Boost
When user completes all 4 requirements:

js
Copy
Edit
if (!userProgress.trust.verified && allRequirementsMet) {
  userProgress.trust.verified = true;
  userProgress.xp += 100;
  userProgress.earnedBadges.push('trustVerified');

  showToast({
    message: `🛡️ Trust Verified — You earned +100 XP`,
    type: 'badge'
  });
}
Also:

Add Trust badge to FSN Library

Auto-equip badge if no other badge is active

Add glowing aura to Signal if user is verified

✅ 4. Simulate Identity Verification (No Real KYC Yet)
Since this is MVP/Phase 0.1:

Replace actual identity upload with a placeholder modal:

“In the future, this step will let you verify with AI or zero-knowledge KYC. For now, click to simulate.”

Include Confirm Verification button that toggles:

js
Copy
Edit
userProgress.trust.requirements.idVerified = true;
✅ 5. Gate Quests and Vault Upgrades by Trust (Optional)
To incentivize opt-in verification:

Add “Trust Required” label on:

Tier 3 vault upgrade

Beacon Level 3

Special XP quests

Premium skins or effects

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
if (!userProgress.trust.verified) {
  lockFeature('BeaconTier3');
}
✅ 6. FSN Social Signal Boost (Cosmetic Only)
If user.trust.verified === true, then:

Signal color = enhanced glow (e.g., white or gold)

Add tooltip on hover:

“🛡️ This user is FSN-Verified”

In social feed or map: small shield icon next to .fsn name

✅ 7. Observer AI Tooltip Integration
If user opens Signal or Vault and isn’t verified:

“🔒 You’re seeing standard tier access. To unlock advanced features, complete your Trust Verification.”
