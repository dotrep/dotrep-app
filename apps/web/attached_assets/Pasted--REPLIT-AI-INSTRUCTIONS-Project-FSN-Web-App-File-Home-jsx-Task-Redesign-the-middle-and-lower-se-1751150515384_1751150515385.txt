üîÅ REPLIT AI INSTRUCTIONS
Project: FSN Web App
File: Home.jsx
Task: Redesign the middle and lower sections of the FSN Home screen to support a tiered identity journey ‚Äî Pulse ‚Üí Signal ‚Üí Beacon ‚Äî using a tabbed quest system, without altering the visual architecture of the existing glyph, Pulse ring, nav bar, XP bar, or ‚ÄúIDENTITY INCENTIVIZED‚Äù styling.

‚úÖ ELEMENTS YOU MUST NOT CHANGE:
Do not modify or reposition the following:

üî∑ The glyph (identity symbol, animated or static)

üåÄ The animated Pulse ring behind the identity card

üß≠ The global navigation bar (top or side)

üÜî The .fsn name (e.g., jason.fsn) and level bar

üí° The glowing phrase ‚ÄúIDENTITY INCENTIVIZED‚Äù

These components form the core identity visual system and must remain visually and spatially anchored at the top section of the Home page.

üß† OBJECTIVE:
Transform the area below the .fsn identity block into a dynamic, gamified ‚ÄúIdentity Journey‚Äù tracker consisting of three unlockable stages:

ü´Ä Pulse ‚Äì user presence and minimal effort

üì° Signal ‚Äì behavioral trust and XP consistency

üõ∞Ô∏è Beacon ‚Äì future-ready visibility and trust-based unlocks

Each stage includes its own quests, unlock conditions, and rewards, presented as a glowing tabbed interface with checklist logic and visual state transitions.

üñ•Ô∏è UI INSTRUCTIONS
üî≥ 1. ADD A GLOWING TAB STRIP BENEATH THE XP BAR
This should be centered and styled to match FSN‚Äôs neon grid aesthetic:

css
Copy
Edit
[ ü´Ä Pulse ]   [ üì° Signal ]   [ üõ∞Ô∏è Beacon ]
Default active tab = Pulse

Disable Signal tab unless pulseComplete === true

Disable Beacon tab unless signalComplete === true

Apply glowing visual effect for completed stages, e.g.:

‚úÖ Pulse complete = cyan glow

üîÑ In progress = flickering ring or white pulse

üîí Locked = grayed out + tooltip

Tooltips on hover (for locked tabs):
‚ÄúUnlock the previous stage to activate this one.‚Äù

üìã 2. DYNAMIC QUEST BLOCK (PER ACTIVE TAB)
Each tab reveals a full-screen card-style checklist of quests.

ü´Ä PULSE (UNLOCKED BY DEFAULT)
Goal: Show up, interact, create a footprint

Quests:

 Upload your first file to your Vault (50 XP)

 Verify your email (25 XP)

 Invite 1 user (30 XP)

When all complete:

Optional:

‚ÄúJoin Trustlist‚Äù button (can open modal or save interest)

‚öôÔ∏è LOGIC TO TRACK
Create React state booleans or Firebase flags:

js
Copy
Edit
pulseComplete = allPulseQuestsCompleted && xp >= 100
signalComplete = pulseComplete && allSignalQuestsCompleted && xp >= 500
beaconEligible = signalComplete
These control:

Tab locking/unlocking

Badge awarding

XP logic

Optional UI effects (like map previews)

‚ú® UX + ANIMATION
Checkmarks animate on quest completion

XP bar updates in real-time

When Pulse or Signal completes, trigger glow/spark animation on corresponding tab

Keep ‚ÄúIDENTITY INCENTIVIZED‚Äù centered and unblocked by quest UI

Use cards or capsule-style buttons for quests ‚Äî do not use basic bullet lists

Match glow aesthetic with FSN brand (neon cyan, white light, digital flicker)

‚úÖ DO NOT REMOVE OR TOUCH:
Glyph

Pulse animation

XP bar

Username

Identity banner and tagline

Nav bar (top or left)

üß† PURPOSE:
This layout transforms the Home page into the narrative backbone of the FSN onboarding experience. It gives users visual confirmation of their progress through a crypto-native identity evolution arc ‚Äî all without KYC, token claims, or outside data vendors. It rewards behavior, not credentials, and visually motivates completion.
