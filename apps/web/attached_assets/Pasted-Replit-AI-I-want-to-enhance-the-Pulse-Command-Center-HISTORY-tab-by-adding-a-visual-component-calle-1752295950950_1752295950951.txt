Replit AI, I want to enhance the Pulse Command Center HISTORY tab by adding a visual component called the “Pulse Chain Constellation.” This will appear directly beneath the "Recent Pulse Activity" heading and function as a **visual activity timeline**, using glowing animated nodes connected by lines.

The layout and colors should exactly match the reference screenshot provided.

Here are the detailed implementation instructions:

---

🎨 1. UI Design

- Create a new container box inside the Pulse Command Center HISTORY tab, titled:
  **“PULSE CHAIN CONSTELLATION”**
  Subtitle: **“Visual Activity Timeline”** (aligned right)
- Match styling to other FSN modals: glowing cyan border, subtle gradient background.

---

🌌 2. Visual Animation Area (Particle Graph)

- Inside the container, create a canvas or SVG-based animation area that displays glowing nodes connected by animated lines.
- Each **node** represents a Pulse milestone (Vault, Signal, NFT, XP).
- Use a subtle **ambient animation** where nodes glow and pulse slightly.
- Node types:
  - **Vault** = Cyan
  - **Signal** = Green
  - **NFT** = Purple
  - **XP** = White

- Connect nodes with glowing animated lines that **match the style of FSN's homepage background animation** (smooth flowing lines, not rigid).

---

🔍 3. Interactivity (for MVP)

- Each node should be **hoverable**:
  - Show a floating tooltip with:
    - Event title (e.g. "Vault Upload")
    - Date & time
    - XP earned

- Optional: Allow dragging or simple zoom if the constellation gets too large.

---

📊 4. Legend Display

- At the bottom of the constellation box, add a **color-coded legend** that maps:
  - 🔵 Vault
  - 🟢 Signal
  - 🟣 NFT
  - ⚪ XP

Use circular color swatches and Orbitron font to match FSN styling.

---

🧪 5. Sample Data (for demo)

- For now, generate 6–8 example nodes using:
  - Random Pulse types
  - Sample dates (July 8–10)
  - Sample XP (40–100)
  - Example tooltips: “Sent secure message”, “Broadcasted at 9.00 MHz”, “Added NFT #001”

---

📦 6. Font and Theme Requirements

- Use **Orbitron** font throughout
- Match neon/cyan/gradient theme of all other FSN panels
- Ensure container padding, corner radius, and glow match Pulse Command Center UI

---

✅ Final Output

The “Pulse Chain Constellation” should appear visually under the HISTORY tab and coexist with the activity filter buttons above. It should feel immersive, alive, and futuristic — like a digital constellation evolving with the user’s reputation.

Do not make it scrollable at this point. Just a contained visual with ambient animation and hover tooltips.

We are not using real data yet, just placeholder examples.
