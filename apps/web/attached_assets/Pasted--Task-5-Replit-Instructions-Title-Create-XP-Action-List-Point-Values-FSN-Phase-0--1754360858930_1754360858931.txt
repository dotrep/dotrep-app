## ✅ Task #5 – Replit Instructions  
**Title**: Create XP Action List + Point Values (FSN Phase 0 – Task 5)

---

### 🎯 Objective  
Define and structure all the XP-earning actions available in Phase 0 of FSN, with their corresponding point values. This list will be used to power the XP engine, rewards system, and future airdrop trust scoring.

---

## 🔧 Cut-and-Paste Instructions

---

### ✅ 1. Create `xpActions.js` inside `/lib` or `/config`

```js
// lib/xpActions.js

const XP_ACTIONS = {
  claim_fsn: 50,
  verify_email: 25,
  verify_phone: 25,
  complete_profile: 10,
  upload_file: 20,
  upload_first_file: 50,
  login_streak_1: 5,
  login_streak_3: 10,
  login_streak_7: 20,
  play_game: 5,
  win_game: 10,
  chat_ai: 5,
  share_referral: 15,
  referral_verified: 50,
  reach_100_xp: 10,
  reach_500_xp: 25,
  reach_1000_xp: 50,
  set_avatar: 10,
  post_feed: 10,
  view_tutorial: 5
};

export default XP_ACTIONS;
```

✅ Use this as the single source of truth for XP across the app

---

### ✅ 2. Add XP fetch utility (optional)

```js
// lib/getXPValue.js

import XP_ACTIONS from './xpActions';

export const getXPValue = (action) => {
  return XP_ACTIONS[action] || 0;
};
```

Use like:
```js
const earnedXP = getXPValue("upload_file");
```

---

### ✅ 3. Add XP constants globally (for Admin Tools / future UI)

Use `XP_ACTIONS` in:
- Admin dashboard (to manually assign/revoke XP)
- XP engine backend triggers
- Gamification prompts (“+20 XP for uploading a file!”)

---

### 📦 Bonus: Add XP metadata to Firestore (for tracking)

For each action a user performs, store:

```js
await addDoc(collection(db, "xpLogs"), {
  uid: user.uid,
  action: "upload_file",
  xpEarned: getXPValue("upload_file"),
  timestamp: serverTimestamp()
});
```

| Invalid XP action name           | ✅ Returns 0                      |

### ✅ Summary

- You now have a structured XP point list for all Phase 0 actions
- XP is consistently earned, logged, and queryable
- This powers gamification, trust scoring, and future airdrop logic
