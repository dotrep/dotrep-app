📌 Objective: Add a fully rendered 3D arcade cabinet to the FSN Game Center screen. It must look like a real arcade machine glowing within the existing UI.

🎯 Placement Instructions:
- Insert the cabinet on the **left side of the screen**, between the two text rows:
   - Top: “Compete • Earn • Dominate”
   - Bottom: “1,247 Active Players | 42 Tournaments | 8.9M XP Earned”
- The cabinet must appear **embedded** within this gap. 
- Push the bottom stats row downward to create vertical space.
- The background and grid must match the existing FSN screen — **no white blocks, frames, or empty voids**.

🎮 Arcade Cabinet Requirements:
- Style: **Fully 3D 1980s upright arcade machine**, angled slightly or facing forward.
- Shape: tall rectangular body with visible side panel depth, control panel overhang, glowing screen, and marquee header.
- Materials: matte black with **cyan-blue neon glowing edge trim** on all surfaces.

📺 Screen Instructions:
- Show a **pixelated smiley face**, styled as blocky 8-bit — **not emoji**, not round.
- Add a **subtle glitch/fuzz effect** on the screen:
   - Horizontal flicker bands or static lines (very light)
   - Faint noise shimmer like a CRT monitor
   - Do NOT use thick scanlines or distort the screen shape
   - Screen should pulse and glow gently, as if alive
   - Think: **old-school CRT screen gently glitching under power surge**

🕹️ Control Panel Details:
- One short joystick on the left (glowing stick, dark base)
- Two glowing circular buttons on the right
- The control panel should project outward in 3D, with proper shading and glow

🔠 Labels:
- Top marquee: **DAILY QUEST** in bright glowing cyan, block-style arcade font
- Bottom of cabinet (optional repeat): **DAILY QUEST** again in same font

🌌 Glow FX & Environment:
- Cabinet must cast a **radial Tron-style glow** on the floor below it
- Soft pulsing shadow or aura under base
- Screen should glow forward slightly (but not blur)
- Entire scene must remain dark, cosmic, and consistent with the FSN theme
- No stars, no fog, no white fills — only the FSN grid + neon accents

🧠 Rules / Fixes:
- Do NOT flatten the cabinet into a wireframe or 2D shape
- Do NOT detach the control panel from the body
- Do NOT center the cabinet — keep it locked to the left side
- Do NOT add characters, faces, or mascots
- Do NOT alter the FSN logo, header, or background grid

This is just the left cabinet (DAILY QUEST). The right side must remain open for future placement.
