 MODULE: “Next Task to Boost Pulse”
📍 This appears below the Pulse gauge on the Home page.

👀 WHAT THIS DOES
This component shows one recommended task the user hasn’t done yet to help them increase their Pulse Hz.
It updates dynamically based on what they’ve already done.

Example:

“+5Hz: Upload your first Vault file”
“+7Hz: Join the FSN Discord”
“+5Hz: Play your first mini mission”

🔧 STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (NO CODE YET)
📁 1. Create: src/components/NextPulseTask.jsx
This is a new component.

It should:

Accept the user’s completed Pulse tasks (from state or mock for now)

Loop through a predefined list of Pulse tasks

Find the first one they haven’t done yet

Display that task with:

✅ Hz reward

✅ Description

✅ Icon (optional)

✅ Glow style to match Pulse dial

🧠 PULSE TASK DATA STRUCTURE
In the same file or a separate constants file (pulseTasks.js), define an array like this:

js
Copy
Edit
[
  { id: "upload_file", label: "Upload your first Vault file", hz: 5 },
  { id: "join_discord", label: "Join the FSN Discord", hz: 7 },
  { id: "play_mini_game", label: "Play a mini mission", hz: 5 },
  { id: "mint_nft", label: "Mint your first Vault NFT", hz: 5 },
  { id: "enable_secure_mode", label: "Activate Vault Security Mode", hz: 7 },
  { id: "follow_user", label: "Follow a user", hz: 3 }
]
📁 2. Modify: Home.jsx
(Or wherever Pulse dial is rendered)

Import the NextPulseTask component

Add it directly below the Pulse gauge

Pass in the list of completed tasks (use mock data at first)

🧪 TEMP DATA FOR TESTING
Until Pulse state is real, use this mock:

js
Copy
Edit
const completedPulseTasks = ["upload_file", "join_discord"];
This would cause the module to show:

+5Hz: Play a mini mission

🎨 STYLING DETAILS FOR REPLIT AI
In NextPulseTask.css, apply the following:

Neon blue text: #00ffff

A glowing left bar or icon

Box-shadow for slight glow

Text format:

🔹 +5Hz: Upload your first Vault file

You can also animate the box subtly or fade it in on hover.

✅ RESULT
On the Home page, under the Pulse dial, users will see:

🔹 +5Hz: Mint your first Vault NFT

And as they complete tasks, this will update to show the next one.

➕ FUTURE ENHANCEMENT (Phase 1+)
Click the task to go straight to that action (e.g., open Vault, launch Game)
