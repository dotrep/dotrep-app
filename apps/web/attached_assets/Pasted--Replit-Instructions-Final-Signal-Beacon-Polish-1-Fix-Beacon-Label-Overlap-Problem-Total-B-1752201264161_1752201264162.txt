✅ Replit Instructions: Final Signal + Beacon Polish
1. 🔧 Fix Beacon Label Overlap
Problem: “Total Broadcasts: 13” overlaps the BEACON label
Fix Instructions:

Move the Total Broadcasts text upward by 20–30px from its current Y position.

Reduce its font size to 80% of the BEACON label font (if BEACON is 24px, use ~18px).

Set the font color to a less bright cyan (e.g. #4fffe2) to create hierarchy beneath the main label.

Use Orbitron font, weight 400 or 500.

Ensure responsive alignment on smaller screens — anchor to top of Beacon panel container.

2. ⚡️ Add Interactivity to Beacon Bars
Goal: Make each beacon bar clickable, showing info about that broadcast.

Instructions:

Wrap each beacon bar div in a button or <div class="beacon-bar" data-frequency="XX" data-timestamp="XX">.

On hover, slightly brighten the bar (opacity: 1.0, transform: scaleY(1.1)).

On click, open a glowing tooltip modal (styled like XP or Pulse modals) that displays:

yaml
Copy
Edit
📡 Frequency: 9.00 MHz  
🕒 Last Cast: 07/10/25 @ 09:17  
💠 XP Gained: +40 XP
Tooltip Modal Design:

Dark blue glassy background with #0ff glow.

Same style as “Pulse Boost” popup, with rounded corners and a slight drop shadow.

Close button in top-right with × icon using Orbitron font.

3. 🌊 Signal Interaction Feedback (CAST Mode)
When the user hits CAST, give immediate broadcast feedback:

Flash a white-blue pulse ring outward from the Signal console.

Style: circular div (border: 2px solid #0ff; border-radius: 50%)

Animate via CSS @keyframes to expand from center (scale 1 → 3) and fade (opacity 1 → 0) over 0.5s.

Simultaneously, trigger a Beacon bar rise animation:

Bar grows upward with transform: scaleY(0 → 1) and opacity: 0 → 1 over 0.3s.

Sync with a sound (if using audio, optional low-volume “broadcast ping” fx).

4. 🎚 Update XP on Broadcast
When the CAST is successful:

Add +25 XP (or whatever your rate is) to the XP counter.

Animate the XP counter in the top-right:

Flash glow for 0.5s on the number.

Animate +25 XP in small Orbitron font floating upward briefly beside the counter before fading.

5. 🛠 Add Lock + Unlock Logic for Frequencies
Ensure the LOCK function disables keypad interaction:

When in LOCKED mode, disable input buttons (pointer-events: none, opacity: 0.4)

Show “🔒 Locked at: 13.0, 9.0 MHz” in the top panel in purple text (#d35fff)

When clicking UNLOCK:

Re-enable inputs

Animate lock button to fade and disappear (or toggle into a “LOCK” button)
