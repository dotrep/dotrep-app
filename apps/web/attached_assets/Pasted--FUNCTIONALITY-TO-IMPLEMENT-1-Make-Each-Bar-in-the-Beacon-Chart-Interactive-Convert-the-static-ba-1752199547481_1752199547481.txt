üß† FUNCTIONALITY TO IMPLEMENT
1. Make Each Bar in the Beacon Chart Interactive
Convert the static bars into individual clickable <div> or <svg> elements.

Each bar should:

Have a hover effect: glow or cyan pulse

On click, show a tooltip or modal with:

Time of last cast

Signal strength (based on Hz)

XP earned from that cast

Option to "Recast" or "Share Beacon"

2. Dynamic Bar Animation When Casting
When a user clicks "CAST" from the signal panel:

Animate the central (tallest) bar in the Beacon.

Light up a wave pattern left ‚Üí right with subtle glow.

Use this as a visual indicator that a Signal is broadcasting to the network.

Add a 2-second pulse glow effect (like a radar ping) to the full Beacon chart.

3. Beacon Chart = Pulse Hz Signal Strength
Map the height of the bars dynamically based on pulseHz (0‚Äì100):

10 bars total.

Pulse strength of 10 Hz = 1 bar, 100 Hz = all 10 bars.

Use Math.floor(pulseHz / 10) to determine how many bars light up.

This makes the Beacon reflect current user power.

4. Add XP Gain on Successful Cast
Each time a user hits CAST:

Add +10 XP to their XP counter.

Log the cast in the XP panel as: +10 XP - Signal Beacon Cast

5. Responsive Design
Make sure the Beacon chart:

Resizes cleanly on mobile and tablet

Does not push other UI elements out of alignment

Still uses cyan neon glow, animated bars, and FSN-styled font (e.g. Orbitron)

üé® Design and Style Notes
Use Orbitron for all text (import via Google Fonts if needed).

Match beacon colors to Pulse and Signal:

Active bars: #00FFFF (Cyan Glow)

Inactive bars: #113344

Hovered bar: #00FFFF with 25% stronger glow

Tooltip modal should match other FSN modals (rounded corners, blue neon border)

üß© OPTIONAL POLISH (if time allows)
Add a "Broadcast Boost" chance ‚Äî 10% chance to earn double XP for a cast (visually display this with a sparkle burst or bonus pop-up)

Add a ‚ÄúTotal Broadcasts‚Äù counter under the Beacon label:

üì° Total Broadcasts: 17

‚úÖ SUCCESS CHECKLIST
 Beacon bar chart animates when casting

 Bars scale with Pulse Hz (1‚Äì10 bars)

 Clicking a bar shows recent cast data

 Casting gives XP and logs to XP popup

 Beacon style matches FSN aesthetic

 Works across desktop and mobile
