Core Concept: Replace the current static Home layout with a live, narrative-based, gamified identity dashboard that tracks the user’s crypto trust journey through three progressive layers: PULSE → SIGNAL → BEACON.

🧠 FSN PHILOSOPHY
This is not just a crypto dashboard. It’s a trust engine.
Every user has a living identity composed of three signals:

Pulse = Identity health & presence

Signal = Behavioral trust over time

Beacon = Global broadcast of that trust

Users don’t “level up” once — they must stay alive, stay active, stay real.
The system should feel alive, responsive, and forgiving — but meaningful.

🛠️ CORE SYSTEM STRUCTURE
🫀 1. PULSE
“Is this user real, active, and stable?”

Score Range: 30–100 (default: 30)
Score Storage: Store as pulseScore (integer, 30–100)

✅ Pulse Score Increases When:
Vault is not empty

First Vault upload complete

Email is verified

Profile picture is set

Login streak ≥ 3 days

.fsn name is active

2FA or backup setup complete

No recent flags

❌ Pulse Decays When:
User misses 3+ days (grace window: 2 days)

Vault is empty

Profile is reset

Negative behavior detected

Decay Curve:

js
Copy
Edit
if (inactivityDays === 3) {
  pulseScore -= 5;
} else if (inactivityDays >= 4 && inactivityDays <= 6) {
  pulseScore -= 10;
} else if (inactivityDays >= 7) {
  pulseScore = Math.max(pulseScore - 15, 30);
}
✅ UI Requirements:
Glowing circular gauge: Pulse Ring

Tooltip:

“Your Pulse reflects your crypto presence and identity health. Keep it strong by staying consistent.”

Never drops below 30 (minimum viable signal)

Animate dimming/flickering when dropping

Highlight “Next Fix”:

“Upload 1 file or log in today to regain Pulse stability.”

📡 2. SIGNAL
“Is this user behaving in a way that builds trust over time?”

Score Range: 0–100
Score Storage: Store as signalScore
Key Rule:

Signal is capped by Pulse.
FinalSignal = min(rawSignalScore, pulseScore)

✅ Signal Score Increases When:
XP earned in past 7 days

Upload frequency is high

Referrals complete onboarding

Game Center missions are completed

Participates in social interactions (post, follow, like)

Maintains a streak

❌ Signal Decays When:
Inactive 7+ days

XP activity drops off

Behavior flagged (bot, spam, fraud)

Decay Curve:

js
Copy
Edit
if (inactivityDays >= 7) {
  signalScore -= 10;
}
✅ UI Requirements:
Horizontal Signal Gauge (like a strength meter)

Dynamic glow based on strength

Tooltip:

“Signal = trust through action. Keep showing up to stay strong.”

Show Signal throttle message:

“Your Signal is being limited by Pulse. Reignite your Pulse to unlock full range.”

🛰️ 3. BEACON
“Can this user project their reputation globally across FSN?”

Unlocked When:

Pulse ≥ 70

Signal ≥ 80

Optional Trust Phase (later)

Store as: beaconStatus = "locked" | "warming_up" | "active"

✅ Beacon Perks:
Appears on the FSN Global Map

Airdrop eligibility (soulbound wallets only)

Vault capacity boost

Governance role access

Advanced quests and staking

🧭 UI Design:
Grayed-out “BEACON CONSOLE” if locked

Tooltip:

“Your Beacon activates once you’ve proven Pulse and Signal strength. Broadcast trust globally.”

Glowing ring + satellite animation once unlocked

📋 XP SYSTEM (Unchanged, but more visible)
Store as: xpTotal, xpLast7Days

Show daily and weekly XP bars

XP unlocks Vault upgrades, quests, and eventual FSN tokens

Add line:

“You’ve earned 325 XP this week. 75 XP to your next bonus.”

🔄 RECOVERY & GRACE SYSTEM
Problem	Recovery
Pulse < 60	Show “Reignite Pulse” quest (login + upload)
Signal capped	Show tooltip: “Improve Pulse to unlock full Signal”
Inactive user returns	Trigger recovery animation + bonus quest
Beacon locked	Show “Warming Up” panel with checklist

Pulse should never feel like punishment.
Always include the line:

“Trust must be earned — and maintained. But it’s always recoverable.”

🧠 ENGAGEMENT & TRAP AVOIDANCE (ENFORCED BY STRUCTURE)
Trap	Countermeasure
Loss Spiral	Pulse never drops below 30; recovery always possible
Shame Lockout	Friendly prompts, not red flags
Reward Cliff	Signal-based perks rotate (missions, vault skins, visibility)
Overchoice	Only show quests based on current tier (Pulse → Signal → Beacon)
Token Tunnel	Beacon + XP = access, but engagement is core
Sybil/Gaming	Pulse is friction-heavy; rewards linked to time-weighted Signal

[ USERNAME.FSN ] [ XP BAR ]
[ PULSE RING ] 🫀 — center glowing gauge
[ SIGNAL GAUGE ] 📡 — dynamic horizontal bar with throttle logic
[ BEACON PANEL ] 🛰️ — locked or glowing
[ QUEST PREVIEW ] (next action shown, e.g., “Upload to stabilize Pulse”)
[ XP STATS ] (daily + weekly)
[ “IDENTITY INCENTIVIZED” TAGLINE ]
🧪 TOOLTIP + COPY LIBRARY (UX-LANGUAGE FRIENDLY)
Pulse (weak):

“Your Pulse is dimming. Log in or upload to your Vault to stabilize your signal.”

Signal (capped):

“Your Signal is strong — but capped by a low Pulse. Boost your identity to broadcast at full range.”

Beacon (locked):

“Your Beacon console is warming up. Reach Pulse 70 and Signal 80 to activate your global trust transmission.”

Re-entry:

“Welcome back, FreeSpacer. Your Pulse flickers — but isn’t gone. Ready to reboot?”

✅ FINAL GOALS FOR REPLIT AI
Modularize Pulse, Signal, and Beacon into reusable components

All gauges must animate

All scores must persist (localStorage or Firebase)

All decay must trigger based on real time since last event

Build for feel, not just logic — glowing rings, flickers, pulses, gradients
