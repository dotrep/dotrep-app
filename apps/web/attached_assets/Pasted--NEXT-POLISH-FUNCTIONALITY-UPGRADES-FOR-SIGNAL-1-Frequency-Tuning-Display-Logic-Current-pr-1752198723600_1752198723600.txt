🔧 NEXT POLISH & FUNCTIONALITY UPGRADES FOR SIGNAL
1. Frequency Tuning Display Logic ✅🛠️
Current problem: Dial shows 0.00 MHz by default, with no interaction when pressing buttons.

Fix:

When the user presses 1–9 or ., the frequency readout updates in real time.

The ON button saves that frequency and activates the mode (CAST or LISTEN depending on last button clicked).

Add logic to cap frequency between 00.00 MHz and 99.99 MHz.

2. Mode Toggle Feedback ✅✨
Current problem: MODE: OFF doesn’t change visibly or give feedback.

Fix:

Pressing CAST, LISTEN, or MULTI should highlight the button, and update the display:

makefile
Copy
Edit
MODE: CAST
FREQUENCY: 23.42 MHz
Background glow or subtle animation could indicate active mode.

If LOCK is clicked, freeze keypad and dial interaction, and update MODE: to:

makefile
Copy
Edit
MODE: CAST (LOCKED)
3. Button Glow + Active State ✅💡
CAST/LISTEN/MULTI/LOCK should:

Glow cyan or neon green when selected.

Only one mode (CAST or LISTEN) can be active.

MULTI can activate only after a second signal is stored (Phase 1).

🎯 ADDITIONAL INTERACTION (PHASE 0 IMMERSIVE)
4. Animated Dial or Meter 🎛️
Visual feedback = mystique and immersion.

Options:

A subtle scanning animation when casting/listening (e.g. MHz digits fluctuate slightly).

Radio-style sweeping glow line across the dial (just visual, no sound yet).

5. XP Feedback Loop (Optional Now) 📈
You could show:

+XP for first time CAST

+XP for setting a frequency

+XP if user keeps signal active for N minutes

Just log to Recent Activity or toast a notification (no need for points right away).

🧠 FUTURE IDEAS FOR “IMPROVING SIGNAL STRENGTH”
You asked “how to improve the signal” — once this is wired up, Signal Strength could become:

Action	Effect
Pulse stays above 80Hz	Stronger casting range
Setting signal to exact FSN freq (e.g. 13.37 MHz)	XP bonus
Interacting with other users at same frequency	unlocks new items
Daily casting streak	Earns stronger “broadcast tier”
Listening to verified users	Boosts trust metrics
