üîß OBJECTIVE:
Build the Vault homepage and a corresponding Data Manager modal system that handles file and NFT storage for the user. This is for Phase 0, so KEYS are not included.

‚úÖ VAULT PAGE (Main View) ‚Äì /vault
LAYOUT & STYLE:
Central layout with the FSN logo inside a glowing ring at the top (reuse from Signal page).

Subheader:
SECURE VAULT
Subtitle text below:
Decentralized storage YOU control

‚ÄúYOU‚Äù should be highlighted in cyan.

DATA SECTION:
Large centered label: DATA

Two category icons below:

FILES (with an upload arrow icon)

NFT (with an NFT wallet icon)

Align both categories horizontally and evenly spaced.

Clicking on either opens the Data Manager modal with the appropriate tab preselected.

DESIGN SYSTEM:
Font: Orbitron for all labels and headers.

Use consistent color system: cyan glow on black with neon highlights.

Background and nav bar same as rest of FSN (dark with connected starfield/lines).

All icons should use SVGs that match the FSN brand style (glowing, minimalist).

üîê DATA MANAGER MODAL (Files + NFTs)
GENERAL MODAL LAYOUT:
Title:
üìÅ Data Manager
Subtitle:
Secure decentralized storage view

Modal should animate in (fade + slight scale-in) and have a cyan border + dark glassy background.

Modal must close:

On clicking the close button

On pressing Esc

On clicking outside the modal

üîπ TAB SYSTEM:
Two tabs:

üß™ TEST CONDITIONS:
Ensure the following are tested:

Files can be uploaded and listed with real metadata.

File rows display correct name, size, date.

Delete confirmation works and removes file.

NFTs tab displays mock/test NFTs in grid format.

Modal closes and opens as expected.

Proper alignment of icons and headers across screen sizes.
