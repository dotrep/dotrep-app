🔭 Batch 4: Pulse → Signal → Beacon Rewrite + FSN Signal Map Prep
🎯 Phase Goals
Module	Goal
Pulse	Clearly show XP-powered progress toward unlocks
Signal	Make Signal unlock feel meaningful, gated, and immersive
Beacon	Visualize Beacon tiers + requirements in a compelling way
Signal Map	Prepare frontend logic and layout for FSN Global Map (placeholder OK)

✅ 1. Pulse Panel: XP Integration + Unlock Teasers
🔧 Update: PulseGauge.jsx
Add level progress ring around Pulse gauge (based on XP)

Overlay “Next Unlock at: 70Hz (Signal)” message below Pulse

Animate glow when XP crosses a threshold that unlocks something

jsx
Copy
Edit
const pulse = user.pulse; // e.g., 55Hz
const nextUnlockPulse = 70;
const unlockReady = pulse >= nextUnlockPulse;

return (
  <div className={`pulse-gauge ${unlockReady ? 'glow' : ''}`}>
    <div className="pulse-value">{pulse} Hz</div>
    <div className="pulse-subtext">
      {unlockReady ? 'Ready to Unlock Signal' : 'Next: Signal at 70Hz'}
    </div>
  </div>
);
✅ 2. Signal Panel: Rewrite Unlock Conditions + Animations
Requirements to Unlock Signal:
Pulse ≥ 70Hz

XP ≥ 100

≥ 1 Broadcast attempted

🔧 Signal Lock Logic (in SignalPanel.jsx or similar):
js
Copy
Edit
const signalUnlocked = user.pulse >= 70 && user.xp >= 100 && user.broadcasts.length >= 1;
If locked:

Show “LOCKED: Reach 70Hz + 100 XP”

Disable all casting or tuning buttons

Pulse the lock icon with subtle animation

If unlocked:

Glow panel in cyan

Show "Mode: Ready" + frequency tuning

Add tooltip: “🛰️ You’re now broadcasting to the FSN constellation”

✅ 3. Beacon Panel: Add Tier Display + Requirements
Create Beacon Tier System:
Tier	Requirements	Visual
🔒 Locked	Signal not yet unlocked	Greyed out
Level 1	Signal unlocked + 3 login streak	Dim bars
Level 2	+5 broadcasts	2 bars lit
Level 3	XP ≥ 750 + 10-day activity streak	3–4 bars lit

Update: BeaconPanel.jsx
Show current tier as progress bars (already exists, just make it dynamic):

js
Copy
Edit
const beaconUnlocked = signalUnlocked && user.loginStreak >= 3;
const beaconLevel = getBeaconLevel(user);

function getBeaconLevel(user) {
  if (!beaconUnlocked) return 0;
  if (user.xp >= 750 && user.loginStreak >= 10) return 3;
  if (user.broadcasts.length >= 5) return 2;
  return 1;
}
Add hover tooltips to each bar:

“Requires 3-day login streak”

“Requires 5 total broadcasts”

“Requires 10-day streak + XP ≥ 750”

✅ 4. Add a Pulse–Signal–Beacon Overview Modal
Optional but HIGHLY recommended — it builds world/lore logic.

Create new file: ConstellationPathModal.jsx

This shows the 3-stage user journey:

txt
Copy
Edit
🌀 Pulse → Emits your identity frequency
📡 Signal → Casts your trust + intent
🔦 Beacon → Lights up the FSN constellation
Each stage has:

XP/behavior requirement

Benefits gained

Glowing ring for unlocked stage

💡 Trigger this modal on first Signal unlock OR by clicking “?” icon near Pulse

✅ 5. Signal Map Prep (Placeholder Version)
This will eventually show a real-time global constellation of active .fsn users. For now, prep:

Add new route/view: /map or modal via “Beacon” panel
Display rotating globe or starfield (placeholder canvas OK)

Show user dot: You Are Here: jason.fsn • Signal Active

Add placeholder:

“🔭 FSN Global Signal Map coming soon.
Your broadcasts will light up the network in real-time.”

Create a dummy data array of users:

js
Copy
Edit
const fakeSignals = [
  { name: 'satoshi.fsn', location: 'Japan', signal: true },
  { name: 'vitalik.fsn', location: 'Canada', signal: true },
  ...
];
Show glowing dots or pins on map/star grid. You can render this with:

SVG overlay

Three.js scene

Canvas 2D (minimal at first)

✅ Final Touch: XP & Signal Toasts
For any Pulse/Signal/Beacon unlock:

jsx
Copy
Edit
showToast({
  message: "📡 Signal Unlocked — You are now broadcasting",
  type: "level-up",
  duration: 3000
});
Create reusable ToastManager.jsx with timed fade/slide animations.

✅ What You’ll Have When Done
System	Result
Pulse	Feels like an XP engine with purpose
Signal	Gated properly, unlocks feel earned
Beacon	Teases status system, tracks daily progress
Signal Map	Early immersion for real-time FSN world
Modal	Explains identity journey and roles
