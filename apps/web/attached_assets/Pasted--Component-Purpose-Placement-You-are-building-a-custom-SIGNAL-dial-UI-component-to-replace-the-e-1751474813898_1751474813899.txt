📌 Component Purpose & Placement
You are building a custom SIGNAL dial UI component to replace the existing SIGNAL widget on the FSN homepage.

This component must:

Match the aesthetic of the other components (PULSE, BEACON)

Be fully functional (interactive knob rotates needle and updates frequency readout)

Be fully readable (clear tick marks, properly spaced numbers)

Integrate seamlessly into the layout with responsive styling

🔁 Replace Existing SIGNAL
Replace the current SIGNAL dial in the FSN UI with this new component. Discard all previous dial markup or styling and start fresh with the following structure and appearance.

🎯 Visual Style & Layout
🌀 DIAL ARC GEOMETRY
Render a 180° semicircle dial

Start angle: 135 degrees (far left)

End angle: 45 degrees (far right)

Use SVG or Canvas for precision rendering

Arc radius: 100px

Dial background color: #00141e

Stroke: neon cyan #00f0ff with 4px width and 10px glow using filter: drop-shadow(0 0 6px #00f0ff)

📏 TICKS & NUMBERS (Dual Circle)
Outer Ring (Major Frequencies):
Display numbers 5 to 16

Total of 12 major ticks (5, 6, 7, ..., 16)

Each number spaced 15 degrees apart across the arc

Font: Orbitron or bold techno-styled sans-serif

Font size: 16px

Neon cyan color with text-shadow: 0 0 4px #00f0ff

Aligned outside arc curve (20px offset from arc path)

Inner Ring (Minor Subdivisions):
Show tick marks every 1 unit, between 5 and 16

Total: 22 ticks (5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 ... 16.0)

Minor ticks: 6px long, 1px thick

Tick color: #00f0ff at 50% opacity

Every other tick (integer numbers only) should have the outer number label

📍 NEEDLE & MOVEMENT
Needle is a thin red line from center to arc edge

Color: #ff0033 with glow 0 0 4px #ff0033

Originates from arc center, rotates to point at correct value

Controlled by rotation transform (transform: rotate(Xdeg))

📟 DIGITAL READOUT (Center)
Show live value like 9.5 in a centered glowing box

Box dimensions: 90px wide × 40px tall

Font size: 22px, color #00f0ff, glow 4px

Font family: Orbitron or monospaced digital font

Background: #00141e, rounded corners, inner glow

Positioned directly beneath the arc with 16px spacing

🔘 ROTARY KNOB (Bottom Center)
Place a circular knob centered horizontally under the readout

Diameter: 48px

Style: concentric circles with radial gradient

Glowing ring border using box-shadow

Use mouse/touch drag to rotate the knob

As knob rotates, update:

Needle position

Frequency value shown in readout

Mapping rule: knob rotation angle (from 135° to 45°) maps linearly to frequencies from 5.0 to 16.0

🧠 Accessibility & Behavior
Ensure all values and numbers are visible and readable

Scale properly on all screen sizes (use vw units or relative scaling)

Implement pointer events for knob interaction

Add keyboard accessibility if time allows (arrow key left/right to adjust)

🔗 Integration Notes
This dial will replace the current SIGNAL section in the FSN UI

It should be placed and sized identically to how the PULSE and BEACON components sit on the page

Background, shadows, and neon glow must match the aesthetic seen in the other components

✅ Final Checklist
 Arc covers full 180° with evenly spaced numbers

 Inner and outer ticks clearly visible and aligned

 Needle rotates accurately to match values

 Digital value is centered and glows

 Rotary knob is functional, glows, and stylish

 Entire component reads clearly and matches visual tone

Proof this prompt fixed it: this version explicitly corrects the previous rendering failure by defining exact arc angles, tick count, spacing, and visual hierarchy — eliminating guesswork.
