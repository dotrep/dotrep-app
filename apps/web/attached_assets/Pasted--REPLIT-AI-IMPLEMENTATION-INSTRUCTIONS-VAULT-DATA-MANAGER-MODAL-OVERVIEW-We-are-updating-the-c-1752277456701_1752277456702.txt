üîß REPLIT AI IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS ‚Äî VAULT + DATA MANAGER MODAL
OVERVIEW
We are updating the current FSN Vault interface to include a Data Manager modal that allows users to view, explore, and manage their uploaded Files and NFTs from a clean, on-brand modal popup. This improves UX while maintaining visual consistency with our glowing, neon-cyan FSN aesthetic.

‚úÖ PART 1: VAULT BUTTON INTERACTION
1. Assign Click Targets
Assign the existing "FILES" and "NFT" buttons as triggers to open the Data Manager Modal.

Remove or hide the "KEYS" button entirely ‚Äî we are not including key management in Phase 0.

2. On Click: Trigger Modal
When a user clicks either FILES or NFT, trigger the modal popup defined below.

‚úÖ PART 2: DESIGN THE MODAL ("Data Manager")
1. Style
Full-screen dark overlay.

Centered modal container with subtle outer glow and soft cyan borders.

Use FSN's standard Orbitron font.

Design colors must match the rest of the app‚Äôs cyan + purple neon theme.

2. Modal Header
Large bold title: "üìÅ Data Manager"

Subheader: "Secure decentralized storage view"

Right-side corner "X" close icon, top-right

‚úÖ PART 3: CONTENT LAYOUT (INSIDE MODAL)
Use tabs or toggle buttons across the top:

Tabs: FILES (default), NFTS

Each tab should dynamically switch content.

A. FILES VIEW (default tab)
Display:

Grid or list of uploaded files

Columns: Filename, Size, Date Uploaded, Download button, Delete icon

Show animated placeholder if no files yet: "No files uploaded. Try sending your first one to the Vault üöÄ"

Buttons at bottom:

"Upload New File" ‚Üí opens native file picker and uploads to IPFS or your decentralized backend

"Back to Vault" ‚Üí closes modal

B. NFT VIEW
Display:

Grid of NFT tiles (image thumbnail + name)

Include token ID, collection, and view on chain button (optional)

If no NFTs: "No NFTs detected in your Vault üß¨"

‚úÖ PART 4: FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR
Uploading a file should immediately update the list in the modal without requiring a reload.

Deleting a file prompts a confirmation modal: ‚ÄúAre you sure you want to delete this file?‚Äù

The modal should not reset when switching tabs (retain scroll position, uploaded content, etc.)

Modal must be fully responsive on all screen sizes, especially mobile.

‚úÖ PART 5: ANIMATIONS + EFFECTS
Animate the modal fading in from the center with slight zoom effect.

Glow hover states on buttons (Upload, Download, Delete)

Subtle particle motion in background like elsewhere in FSN

‚úÖ PART 6: CODE ORGANIZATION SUGGESTIONS
Place modal component in components/Modal/DataManager.vue (or .js/.jsx if using React)

Route uploads to backend /upload/file endpoint (assumes IPFS or similar)

Save NFT data as JSON in /vault/nftData.json mock for now if you‚Äôre not using an on-chain connection yet
