🛠️ TITLE: Final Cockpit Gauge Conversion — Visual Match with Design Reference
Please upgrade the current Trust Engine layout inside the FSN Home tab to match the attached visual reference image. This is a cockpit-style, glowing UI with circular gauges for PULSE, SIGNAL, and BEACON — each with tick marks and dynamic indicators — plus contextual quests and status tiles below.

✅ 1. GAUGE STRUCTURE (Top Section)
Replace existing arc/partial bars with full, stylized circular gauges like in the reference:

Label	Gauge	Visual
🫀 Pulse	Circular meter (left)	Ticks, glowing radial arc
📡 Signal	Circular meter (center)	Needle shows score, glow based on strength
🛰️ Beacon	Circular meter (right)	Lock if inactive, rotates if active

Style Notes:

Use glowing neon blue/cyan lines

Each gauge should have:

Dynamic needle position

Tick marks like RPM meters

Glow intensity that increases with score

Optional flicker if low (Pulse < 40, Signal < 20)

Layout:

Copy
Edit
[ PULSE ]   [ SIGNAL ]   [ BEACON ]
Centered under .fsn name and XP display.

✅ 2. ACTION PANELS (Bottom Section)
Create three tile boxes directly beneath the gauges:

Left	Center	Right
🫀 Pulse Quests
• Upload File
• Verify Email
• Set Profile Pic	📶 Signal Status
• [ ON / OFF Toggle ]	🛰️ Beacon Status
• “Complete all Signal quests to unlock”

Style:

Use rounded boxes with cyan borders

Text in small caps

Add glowing toggle switch in Signal panel

✅ 3. TEXT ELEMENTS
.fsn name centered above the gauges

XP value below it

Tagline below tiles:

Copy
Edit
IDENTITY INCENTIVIZED
Use consistent neon typography across all components

✅ 4. INTERACTIONS & STATES
Status	Visual
Low Pulse	Flickering ring, “DIM” label
Signal Capped	Signal meter glows at cap, tooltip: “Capped by Pulse”
Beacon Locked	Lock icon inside gauge, dimmed
Beacon Online	Glowing radar sweep

🧪 5. ANIMATION & TRANSITIONS (Optional Phase)
Animate gauges on load or XP gain

Animate needle movement when score changes

Flash Signal tile briefly when user completes a quest

✅ 6. MOBILE RESPONSIVE
Stack vertically in this order:

.fsn name

XP

SIGNAL

BEACON

Quests/status tiles

“IDENTITY INCENTIVIZED”

Ensure all gauges and panels resize proportionally.

🔐 MUST KEEP (FROM CURRENT BUILD)
