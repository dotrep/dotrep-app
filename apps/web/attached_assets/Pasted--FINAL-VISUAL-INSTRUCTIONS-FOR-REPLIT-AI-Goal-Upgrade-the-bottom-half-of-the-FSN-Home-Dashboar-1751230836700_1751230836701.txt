üõ† FINAL VISUAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT AI
üß† Goal: Upgrade the bottom half of the FSN Home Dashboard to match the attached cockpit-style image exactly, improving gauge design, lighting, and structure.
‚úÖ SECTION 1: Keep These Top Elements UNCHANGED
Do not modify the following:

Top nav bar (Home, Vault, Social, Game Center)

.fsn username (e.g. rachel_2183.fsn)

XP display (e.g. 325 XP)

‚ú® SECTION 2: Improve the GAUGES
Gauge	Current Issue	Fix
Pulse	No glow, needle too flat	Add radial tick marks, glowing inner ring, and sharper needle. Animate on change.
Signal	Slightly better but too static	Add glow effect, needle inertia, and dynamic pulse based on trust level.
Beacon	Missing radar or sense of activation	Add radar sweep ring that rotates when active. Lock icon should fade when Beacon is unlocked.

ALL GAUGES MUST HAVE:

Neon cyan or white glow

Tick marks (like cockpit RPM meters)

Glowing dynamic needles that move when score changes

Flicker at low levels (optional)

Radar sweep animation on Beacon (if online)

Use reference image for glow intensity, thickness, and realism.

‚úÖ SECTION 3: Tile Layout Enhancements (Bottom Row)
You already have the correct 3-panel structure ‚Äî now enhance:

Panel	Fixes
Pulse Quests	Add brighter border, make ‚ÄúPULSE QUESTS‚Äù title slightly bolder, use light cyan bullets (‚úÖ), align text perfectly
Signal Toggle	Style ON/OFF switch like glowing neon (see reference image), animate toggle. Background panel should glow slightly
Beacon Panel	Soften the text, remove ‚Äújagged‚Äù font style. Add a soft radar glow behind or around the panel (even if beacon is locked). Subtle lock shimmer when hovering.

‚úÖ SECTION 4: Add Motion and Lighting FX
Add subtle glowing dust particles or node lines behind the gauges (Tron-style background effect)

Slight pulse animation on gauge borders

XP or signal increase triggers a brief pulse or glow expansion

Add soft drop shadows under gauges and tile boxes

‚úÖ SECTION 5: ‚ÄúIDENTITY INCENTIVIZED‚Äù Footer
Keep centered

Increase brightness to match neon gauge style

Animate a slow pulsing glow behind the letters

Optional: add horizontal tracer line underneath like an energy bar
