Vault Page Overhaul
🔁 1. Reset Vault Page Layout
Completely clear the current layout and styling of the existing vault page.

Inherit global structure and layout from the other pages (like Home):

Reuse the same background, pulse glyph header, and nav bar component.

Ensure the Vault tab is highlighted in cyan just like Home and others when selected.

🧭 2. Header and Navigation Bar Matching
Ensure top nav bar contains:

HOME, VAULT (highlighted), SOCIAL, GAME CENTER

Include the XP counter on the top right (865 XP as placeholder) with the same style as on the Home tab.

Reuse the Pulse glyph animation directly from Home, keeping it centered and glowing.

🧊 3. Main Vault Section Redesign
Centered Title Block
Title: SECURE VAULT in cyan neon

Subtext: "Decentralized storage YOU control"

Use same typographic styling as other tabs

Below That: DATA PANEL
Create two modular square buttons centered under the "DATA" heading.

Use a flex row with spacing between them.

🔲 4. Replace Old Icons + Add Boxes
Left Box – Upload File

Label: Upload File

Icon: Folder with "+" (adjust styling to match your Files modal)

Subtext: 15 Files (this can be dynamically populated later)

Right Box – Add NFT

Label: Add NFT

Icon: Diamond or Ethereum-shaped icon (stylized)

Subtext: 3 NFTs

Add hover effects:

Glow effect on hover (light cyan)

Smooth expand/shrink animation

💾 5. Vault Functional Modal: Data Manager
When either square is clicked:

Open the existing Data Manager modal as shown in your screenshot.

Include two tabs inside:

FILES – default selected

NFTs

In FILES tab:
Table headers: Filename, Size, Date Uploaded, Actions

Each row should display:

Label: File

0 Bytes

Placeholder: Invalid Date (until data is connected)

Icons for Download and Delete (fix any broken/fallback icons)

In NFT tab:
Placeholder message: "No NFTs added yet" or show grid of NFTs with title & image

🧩 6. Functional Triggers
Make each Upload File and Add NFT box trigger opening of the Data Manager modal with correct tab selected:

Click “Upload File” → open modal on FILES tab

Click “Add NFT” → open modal on NFTs tab

🖼️ 7. Design Polish
Match color palette: cyan-blue neon, deep navy background, Tron-style aesthetic

Keep padding/margins consistent with Home page

Buttons and modal borders should have subtle outer glow

Add hover state to NFTs/files list if feasible (optional)

🔄 8. Make It Reusable
Modularize:

VaultPage

DataManagerModal

NavBar (reuse from HomePage)

Components should allow state toggling for visibility/modal logic.
