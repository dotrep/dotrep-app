ith:
A glowing circular dial (similar to cockpit speedometer)

Cyan Tron-style ring with segmented ticks

Radial glow intensifies as score increases

Pulse Levels:
Score	Visual Effect
≥ 70	Bright glow, stable ring
40–69	Dimmer glow, “STABLE” label
< 40	Flickering edges, warning halo, “WEAK” label

Animations:
Animate ring fill from previous to new value

Show wave ripple on Pulse increase

Tooltip:
“Your Pulse reflects your identity health and stability.”

📡 2. SIGNAL GAUGE (Upgrade the current arc)
Convert current half-arc into:
A full arc-style signal meter with:

Radial tick marks

Fill animation

Neon blue glowing sweep

Signal Levels:
Score	Visual
0–24	Flicker, red glow at edge, label: “WEAK”
25–69	Smooth glow, label: “STABLE”
70–100	Bright cyan glow, label: “STRONG”

If Signal is capped by Pulse:
Overlay a translucent block at Pulse threshold

Show tooltip:

“Your Signal is capped by a low Pulse. Reignite your Pulse to unlock full Signal strength.”

🛰️ 3. BEACON CONSOLE
Keep existing Beacon box, but fully upgrade:
Show a circular radar dish with sweeping animation

Add console-style framing

Label states clearly:

Status	Visual
OFFLINE	Dim radar, red text, lock icon
WARMING UP	Radar pulses + circular animation
ONLINE	Cyan glow, pulsing ring + text: “BEACON ONLINE”

Animate when unlocked:
Sweep radar activates

“BEACON ONLINE” text fades in

Add subtle background glow or particle orbit

Tooltip:
“Your Beacon activates once Pulse and Signal are strong enough. This unlocks global visibility and access.”

✨ 4. XP DISPLAY & ANIMATION
Keep existing XP score and XP Progress: 325 / 500

Add:

Glowing XP progress bar (horizontal)

Animate progress bar fill on XP gain

Optional +XP popup or mini-confetti effect

Tooltip:
“XP unlocks Vault skins, quests, and future token access.”

🔁 5. NEXT ACTION MODULE
Keep logic (e.g., “Log in daily to maintain Pulse”)

Add dynamic icon:

🫀 = Pulse task

📶 = Signal task

Flash a subtle border glow when action is completed

📱 6. RESPONSIVE LAYOUT
Desktop Layout	Mobile Layout
PULSE	Top left
SIGNAL	Top center
BEACON	Top right
XP / Next Action	Bottom bar

Stack vertically on mobile

Keep nav bar and XP always accessible

🔒 7. LOGIC TO MAINTAIN
Do not reset or change pulseScore, signalScore, or beaconStatus

Continue using finalSignal = min(rawSignal, pulseScore)

Preserve gating:

Beacon unlocks at Pulse ≥ 70 AND Signal ≥ 80

Never let Pulse drop below 30

✅ 8. STYLE GUIDANCE
All gauges must use Tron-style glow (neon cyan/blue)

Use animated transitions not static score jumps

Gauges should pulse gently at idle

Use text like: WEAK, STABLE, STRONG under gauges

Background should include faint Tron gridlines and ambient particle drift

✨ 9. FINAL TOUCHES
Event	Visual
Pulse + Signal both increase	UI briefly pulses cyan
Beacon unlocked	Modal or toast: “BEACON ONLINE — Global projection active”
XP gain	Flash bar, optional +XP float
User returns after decay	Toast: “Welcome back. Your Pulse is stabilizing.”

✅ SINGLE SUMMARY LINE FOR REPLIT:
Please enhance the current Trust Engine by converting all Pulse, Signal, and Beacon indicators into fully animated Tron-style gauges with glow, cap logic, tooltips, and signal feedback — maintaining all live logic and navigation, and presenting the final Home dashboard as a responsive, cockpit-style crypto identity engine.
