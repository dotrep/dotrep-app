🎮 Design an arcade cabinet for the FSN Game Center screen that combines a stylized glowing aesthetic with real-world arcade structure.

📐 Perspective:
- Rotate the cabinet about **15 degrees inward**, so it faces toward the center of the screen.
- Show a classic **3/4 arcade angle**, revealing both the front and left side.

📦 Cabinet Shape (Hybrid Style):
- Use a **tall rectangular body** — no tapering.
- Include a **sloped control panel** that juts outward beneath the screen (angled like a real arcade cabinet).
- Add a **visible lower front panel** below the controls — flat and boxy, no curves or floating elements.

🖼️ Screen:
- Display a glowing **pixel-style smiley face** centered on the screen.
- No bevel or CRT depth — screen should glow outward with light fuzz or static flicker.
- Add neon edge glow around the screen like a Tron UI.

🎛️ Control Panel (Realistic Layout):
- Angled panel should feature:
   • 1 joystick with a thin stick and round ball top (left side)
   • 2 glowing round buttons (right side)
- Controls should be built **into** the panel — not floating or pasted on.

🧱 Cabinet Base:
- Include a boxy **base panel** beneath the control section (no coin slots, just structure).
- Keep the entire cabinet **symmetrical and vertically aligned**.

🌌 FX & Integration:
- Apply **cyan-blue neon edge glow** around the cabinet
- Add a **soft glowing ripple** on the ground to anchor the cabinet into the FSN Game Center UI
- Match the lighting and aesthetic of the existing FSN page (dark cosmic grid background, electric cyan accents)

🧠 DO NOT:
- Do not use a realistic CRT display or physical textures
- Do not over-render fine realism details — keep it clean and iconic
- Do not create a tapered or cartoony cabinet
- Do not float the control panel or distort the perspective

✅ Summary:
- Think of this as a **glowing Tron-style cabinet** with the layout and structure of a real machine (like Space Ace or Galaga), embedded into a digital interface.
