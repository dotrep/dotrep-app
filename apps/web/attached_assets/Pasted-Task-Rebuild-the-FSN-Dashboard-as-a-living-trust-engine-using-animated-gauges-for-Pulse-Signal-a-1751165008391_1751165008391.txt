Task: Rebuild the FSN Dashboard as a living trust engine, using animated gauges for Pulse, Signal, and Beacon — but fully preserve the navigation structure of the platform.

🔁 CONTEXT
You previously replaced the static quest boxes with a basic version of the Pulse/Signal/Beacon scoring system. That was a great first step.

However, the navigation bar was removed, and the layout became detached from the rest of FSN. Please now rebuild the interface so it feels like a powerful upgrade to the Home tab — not a full-page modal or alternate view.

🔧 CORE INSTRUCTIONS
✅ 1. Restore the Navigation Bar
The main dashboard must include the existing tabs at the top:

css
Copy
Edit
[ HOME ]  [ VAULT ]  [ SOCIAL ]  [ GAME CENTER ]
These should be present and functional at all times.

The Home tab should now contain the Trust Engine view, not be replaced by it.

Do not use a full-screen overlay or hide any of the tabs.

✅ 2. Implement the Full Trust Engine (Inside the Home Tab)
You will be building a live dashboard powered by three interrelated systems:

🫀 PULSE
Represents identity health and consistency
Stored as: pulseScore (range: 30–100)

Visual:
Circular Pulse Ring gauge (Tron-style glow)

Dim or flicker when score < 60

Tooltip:

“Pulse = identity health. Upload to your Vault and stay active to keep your Pulse strong.”

Decay logic:
Grace period: no decay for 2 days of inactivity

-5 if 3 days inactive

-10 if 4–6 days

-15 per week thereafter (min floor = 30)

📡 SIGNAL
Represents trust through behavioral activity
Stored as: signalScore (0–100)
Final score is capped by Pulse score

Visual:
Horizontal Signal Strength Bar

Animate fill level dynamically

Show throttle condition:

“Your Signal is capped by Pulse. Boost your Pulse to unlock full broadcast power.”

🛰️ BEACON
Represents global broadcast readiness
Stored as: beaconStatus ("locked", "warming_up", "active")

Unlock condition:
Pulse ≥ 70

Signal ≥ 80

(Optional Trust check in future phase)

Visual:
Beacon Console panel

Gray when locked, glowing when active

Tooltip:

“Your Beacon will activate once your Pulse and Signal are strong. This unlocks map visibility, token access, and more.”

🧠 LOGIC & STATE
Store the following variables for each user:

pulseScore

signalScore

rawSignalScore

xpTotal

xpLast7Days

beaconStatus

Pulse must cap the final Signal score like this:

js
Copy
Edit
finalSignalScore = Math.min(rawSignalScore, pulseScore)
🔄 NEXT ACTION MODULE
Display a "Next Action" prompt beneath the gauges:

Example:

“Upload a file or log in today to increase your Pulse strength.”
“Earn 50 more XP this week to improve your Signal.”

This section should change dynamically based on user state.

🧪 XP Section (Keep Existing)
Display:

Total XP

XP earned in last 7 days

Animated XP bar or counter

Add XP unlock tooltip:

“XP unlocks Vault skins, quests, and token access.”

🔁 LAYOUT (STACKED)
css
Copy
Edit
[ NAV BAR: HOME | VAULT | SOCIAL | GAME CENTER ]

[ .fsn NAME ]  [ XP COUNTER ]

[ PULSE RING GAUGE ] 
[ SIGNAL METER ]
[ BEACON CONSOLE ]

[ NEXT ACTION PROMPT ]
[ XP STATS + BAR ]

[ IDENTITY INCENTIVIZED ]
Ensure this layout is responsive and mobile-friendly:

Stack vertically on mobile

Keep nav accessible

Scale gauges proportionally

✅ UX POLISH
All gauges should animate based on real-time state changes

Add hover tooltips for all scores

Add flicker/glow/dim effects to show status transitions

Never hard-fail — always offer recovery quests when Pulse or Signal are low

🚫 DO NOT:
Do not hide or remove the main nav bar

Do not use modals or overlays to show gauges

Do not reset scores visually unless the user is flagged or reset manually
