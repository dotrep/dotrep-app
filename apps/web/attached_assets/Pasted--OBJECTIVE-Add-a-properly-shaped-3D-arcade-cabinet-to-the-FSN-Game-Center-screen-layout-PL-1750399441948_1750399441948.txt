🎯 OBJECTIVE: Add a properly shaped 3D arcade cabinet to the FSN Game Center screen layout.

📍 PLACEMENT:
- Position the cabinet on the **left side of the screen**, between the two text rows:
   • Top row: “Compete • Earn • Dominate”
   • Bottom row: “1,247 Active Players | 42 Tournaments | 8.9M XP Earned”
- Push the bottom row downward so the cabinet fits cleanly.
- The cabinet must be fully embedded — do NOT float it. It should look like it belongs in the FSN world.

🎮 CABINET DESIGN (FIXED STRUCTURE):
- Use a **real 1980s upright arcade shape**, not a stack of boxes.
- Cabinet must be **fully 3D**:
   • Curved edges and tapering top
   • Angled base visible in perspective
   • Depth on the left side to show volume
- Control panel should be **built into the cabinet body**, not pasted on.
   • It must extend slightly outward at a slope, NOT as a separate block.

🕹️ PANEL ELEMENTS:
- One short joystick on the left
- Two glowing cyan-blue buttons on the right
- Add soft underglow to the panel

📺 SCREEN:
- Display a glowing pixelated smiley face (blocky 8-bit, not emoji)
- Add a **light CRT flicker effect**:
   • Subtle scanline shimmer or horizontal jitter
   • Gentle fuzz or static glow — like a powered-on CRT screen
   • Screen should emit forward-facing blue glow (NOT blur)

🔠 TEXT LABELS:
- Top marquee: “DAILY QUEST” in bold, cyan glowing block font
- Optional repeat: “DAILY QUEST” at the base of cabinet

🌌 FX & GROUNDING:
- Cabinet must cast a **soft neon ripple** on the floor (Tron-style radial glow)
- Add faint shadow below the machine to ground it visually
- Do not float or leave white boxes around the object

🧠 FSN BACKGROUND RULES:
- Maintain FSN background: dark grid pattern with glowing cyan lines
- Do NOT overwrite or flatten the existing layout
- Do NOT remove the Game Center header or FSN glyph

📋 LAYOUT INTEGRITY:
- Restore the full Game Center layout:
   • Keep “Game Center” title + “Compete • Earn • Dominate”
   • Push “Active Players | Tournaments | XP Earned” row downward so it’s still fully visible
- Do not shrink or compress text — layout should feel balanced and futuristic

🛑 DO NOT:
- Do not create flat 2D rectangles
- Do not float the control panel
- Do not remove the stat row
- Do not center the cabinet
- Do not add mascots or extra UI
