✅ OBJECTIVE
You are upgrading the lower half of the Home Dashboard to exactly match the visual style and layout of the attached cockpit-style reference image, while preserving the existing nav bar, XP bar, and username area at the top.

🧩 COMPONENT 1: GAUGES
General Gauge Requirements (all 3)
Use concentric glowing rings (white neon + cyan accents)

Radial tick marks (dotted/short segments) at 10-point intervals (0–100)

Needles: Use sharp, solid, centered needles — not soft lines

Glow effects:

Outer ring = soft white neon glow

Inner center = cyan radial pulse

Flickering red outline if score is low

Font inside gauge = Eurostile Bold or similar all-caps, spaced out

Pulse animation when score updates

PULSE Gauge
Centered left

Needle should animate from 0–100 based on Pulse score

Tick marks styled as white notches, with every 10-point mark emphasized

Label: PULSE (centered under dial, bold, glowing)

Use icon you already implemented next to label

SIGNAL Gauge
Centered

Needle based on calculated Signal score

Same visual as Pulse gauge, but add animated glow or breathing effect

Add optional flickering red glow if Signal < 20

Label: SIGNAL (same styling)

BEACON Gauge
Centered right

This gauge starts disabled

Instead of a needle, use a radar-style sweep (rotating arc inside the dial)

If locked: show dimmed lock icon inside

If unlocked: replace lock with rotating scanner arc

Label: BEACON, glows purple with soft radar pulse behind it

Optional: Make the dial perimeter a ring with ringed radar blips

🧩 COMPONENT 2: QUEST PANELS (3 Boxes Below Gauges)
PULSE QUESTS Panel (left)
Add glowing neon cyan border

Use glowing green ✅ checkmarks on completed tasks

Bold section header: PULSE QUESTS

Font: all-caps, spaced, glowing cyan

Fix vertical spacing — current layout feels unbalanced

SIGNAL TOGGLE Panel (center)
Keep the toggle but:

Enlarge the ON/OFF switch

Apply neon glow (ON = cyan, OFF = gray)

When ON, glow around the box softly pulses

Make background panel slightly brighter with glowing border

Font = bolder and spaced, matching PULSE QUESTS

BEACON LOCK Panel (right)
Update to:

Label: BEACON CONSOLE

Subtext: Complete all Signal quests to unlock

Add dim radar display (visual background element)

Apply subtle purple glow effect

🧩 COMPONENT 3: IDENTITY INCENTIVIZED Footer
Center this title

Use Eurostile Extended or Space Mono font (or nearest match)

Add a subtle cyan/white horizontal tracer line underneath

Pulse glow behind text every 5 seconds (animated)

Ensure text does not wrap or get pushed off-screen on smaller viewports

✨ COMPONENT 4: BACKGROUND FX (Behind Everything)
Add floating network node grid

Random twinkling star-like lights

Gentle animated horizontal scan line behind gauges (opacity < 10%)

Light layer of dust particle motion for movement illusion

🔄 COMPONENT 5: STATE-BASED DYNAMICS
Gauge	State	Animation
Pulse	Inactive	Needle rests at 30, dim glow
Pulse	Active	Needle animates with score, glow pulses
Signal	Low (<20)	Flickering red glow on outer edge
Signal	Mid (20–70)	Cyan glow stable
Signal	High (70+)	Cyan glow pulses
Beacon	Locked	Lock icon visible, dimmed ring
Beacon	Unlocked	Replace lock with rotating radar arc (SVG or CSS rotate)

⚙️ COMPONENT 6: DATA SOURCING (Hook into Logic)
Pull values from the following states:

pulseScore = 0–100 → drives Pulse gauge

signalScore = 0–100 → drives Signal gauge

beaconStatus = true/false → locked or unlocked

pulseQuestsCompleted = array → toggle checkmarks

signalQuestsCompleted = boolean → unlocks beacon panel

XP = displayed above, do not duplicate
