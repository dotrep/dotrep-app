Goal:
Clean up layout, spacing, UX rough edges, and consistency across all panels before Phase 0.2 (airdrop, waitlist, map, wallet, or DAO logic).

✅ 1. Layout & Spacing Fixes
🔧 Pulse/Signal/Beacon Row
 Ensure these are visually centered and evenly spaced

 Add hover tooltips for each:

Pulse: “Your crypto frequency”

Signal: “Cast your presence to FSN”

Beacon: “Mark your place on the network”

🔧 Vault Layout
 Add bottom margin so content doesn’t scroll off-screen

 Ensure file/NFT sections scale properly with number of uploads

 Display “Total storage used: X GB / Y GB” at bottom

 Fix any float-overlap issues with badges/NFTs near the vault summary

🔧 XP Header
 Make XP count + level glow subtly on hover

 Ensure spacing doesn’t crowd top navbar or mission tracker toggle

 Pulse the XP ring briefly after XP is earned

✅ 2. Mobile & Responsive Touch-Ups
 Hide or collapse Mission Tracker on mobile screen widths (< 768px)

 Fix layout issues in Game Center on smaller devices (buttons breaking rows)

 Add hamburger menu if nav elements stack

✅ 3. Loading State & Edge Case Handling
 Add loading spinners for:

Vault loading

XP recalculation

Signal broadcast

 Gracefully handle:

User has 0 XP

No files uploaded yet

No badge earned yet

Use empty state messages:

txt
Copy
Edit
"You haven’t uploaded anything yet. Start building your vault."
"You haven’t earned any badges... yet. Try completing a mission!"
✅ 4. Icon & Color Audit
🔧 Consistency Pass
 All icons (Pulse, Signal, Beacon, Mission Tracker, Vault, XP, etc.) should:

Use same color scheme (Tron-cyan, white, yellow, magenta)

Be SVGs or styled React icons for scalability

Include alt text or accessible labels for hover/click

 Background gradients or borders should match the FSN brand:

Black background: #0a0a1a

Tron glow: #00ffff

Badge glow: #f0f or #ff0

✅ 5. Sound Control Settings
 Add mute/unmute toggle (top-right corner or settings drawer)

 Default = ON

 Store setting in localStorage or userPrefs:

js
Copy
Edit
userPrefs.soundFX = true;
Apply sound setting to:

XP gain

Level up

Badge unlock

Quest complete

Signal cast

✅ 6. Error & Alert Messaging
 Add global toast or modal for:

Upload failure

XP cap reached (if you plan to implement XP daily limits)

Invalid file type or oversized file

Attempt to broadcast without enough XP

Example Toast:
🚫 Cannot broadcast. You need 70Hz Pulse and 100 XP.

✅ 7. Code Cleanup & Dev Tools
 Remove console logs or placeholder TODO: comments

 Comment major functions clearly (e.g. “// Handles vault upgrade logic”)

 Use DEV_MODE = true toggle in settings for debugging features (fake XP, unlock all, etc.)

✅ 8. Final Avatar/Badge/UI Visual Lock
 Lock in final visual pipeline:

Avatar art style: stroke width, neon glow, modular compatibility

Badge shape & framing: circular? card-style?

Button and modal corner radius: soft 2xl across all pages

 Use consistent component names (.badge-card, .vault-panel, etc.)

✅ 9. Mission Tracker Reset / Reuse
 If user finishes all 5 onboarding missions:

Optionally allow daily XP missions (rotate with quests)

Example:

"🔄 Upload 2 files today (+20 XP)"

"💬 Broadcast your Signal (+15 XP)"

"🎮 Complete a daily quest (+25 XP)"

 Add missions.completed = true flag in userProgress

 Prevent badge/NFT rewards from being given twice unless allowed

✅ 10. Final Phase 0.1 Review Hook
Optional but smart — add a self-check modal to show Phase 0.1 completion

jsx
Copy
Edit
if (user.xp >= 500 && signalUnlocked && badgeCount >= 3) {
  showModal("✅ Phase 0.1 Complete — You're now Core Ready");
}
