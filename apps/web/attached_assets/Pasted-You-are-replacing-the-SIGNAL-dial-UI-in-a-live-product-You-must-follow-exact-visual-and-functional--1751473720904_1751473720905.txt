You are replacing the SIGNAL dial UI in a live product. You must follow exact visual and functional instructions.

🧠 Project Overview:
You are building a functional neon-glow SIGNAL tuner dial that:

Replaces the current placeholder SIGNAL component on the homepage (center bottom).

Must match the design reference shown in the file: signal_reference_dial.png

Must display correctly spaced, sequential radio numbers

The red needle must rotate based on user interaction with the knob

🎨 Style + Integration Guidelines:
Design Must Match This Image Exactly:
→ signal_reference_dial.png

Rounded semi-arc dial with a neon blue glow

Outer ring: large radio numbers (5 to 16) spaced equally

Inner ring: decimal numbers (5.5 to 14.5)

Red needle starting at 9.5

Rectangular neon-lit digital readout in the center

Single round knob at bottom center

Integrate into This Homepage Layout:
→ fsn_home.png

Keep dial size proportionate to the Pulse and Beacon components

Use similar neon glow, spacing, and depth shadows

Do NOT Repeat This Mistake:
→ signal_garbled.png

This version has incorrect labels, bad spacing, and poor legibility

The arc is compressed and not readable

The needle does not visually connect to the digital number

🔧 Functionality Requirements:
User should be able to click and drag the knob to rotate the red needle

As the needle moves, the digital display updates in real-time

The digital value shown must match the number the needle is pointing to

Needle range: 5.0 to 16.0 (outer arc); 5.5 to 14.5 (inner arc)

Decimal numbers should be equally spaced and accurate

All numbers must be centered and readable — no truncation

📐 Numbers and Alignment:
Outer Arc Labels: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16

Inner Arc Labels: 5.5, 6.5, ..., 14.5

Start Angle: Left side of arc at 5.0

End Angle: Right side of arc at 16.0

Red Needle Default: Points at 9.5

Digital Display: Shows “9.5” centered in blue-glow box

🧪 Tech Notes:
Use Canvas, SVG, or WebGL for animated dial (your choice)

The red needle can be rotated using transform: rotate(angle) from a center pivot

The knob is purely aesthetic — rotation updates needle programmatically

Keep all fonts and strokes legible, modern, and sci-fi styled
