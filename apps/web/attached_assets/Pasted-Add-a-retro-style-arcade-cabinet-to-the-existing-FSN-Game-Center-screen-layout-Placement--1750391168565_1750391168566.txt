Add a retro-style arcade cabinet to the existing FSN Game Center screen layout.

🎯 Placement:
- Place the cabinet on the **left side of the screen**, between the following two text rows:
   - Top: “Compete • Earn • Dominate”
   - Bottom: “1,247 Active Players | 42 Tournaments | 8.9M XP Earned”
- Push the bottom stats row downward to make room.
- The cabinet must feel fully embedded in the layout — no white box or extra frame.
- Background must be identical to the FSN grid style — same glow, same cosmic black theme.

🎮 Cabinet Design:
- Style: **1980s upright arcade machine**, facing straight forward (not angled).
- Shape: rectangular cabinet with a tall vertical screen, top marquee panel, and control panel at waist height.
- Body: matte black metal with **neon cyan-blue glowing trim** on all edges.
- Size: roughly fills the vertical gap between the two text rows, with good spacing above and below.

📺 Screen Details:
- Display a **pixelated smiley face**, blocky and 8-bit style (not emoji).
- Add a **subtle animated flicker/glitch effect**:
   - Simulate a faint glow pulse on the screen
   - Overlay light “CRT flicker” texture: subtle horizontal jitter lines or pixel noise
   - Do **not** add thick scanlines or full-screen distortion
   - No blur or warping — the face must remain clear and intact
   - Think of a **CRT screen gently glitching** from power fluctuation or signal fuzz, with glowing pixel shimmer
- Smiley face should have:
   - Two vertical oval eyes
   - A smooth but pixelated smile
   - Bright cyan glow around the screen edges

🕹️ Control Panel:
- Two circular glowing cyan buttons (on the right side)
- One short joystick (on the left side), black base with glowing stick
- Panel should glow slightly from underneath, matching FSN neon lighting

🔠 Labels:
- Top marquee: **“DAILY QUEST”** in bold block font, glowing cyan-blue
- Bottom panel (repeat): also says **“DAILY QUEST”**, same font and glow — this is intentional, not a mistake

🌌 FX + Environment:
- Cabinet casts a soft radial glow on the floor — Tron-style ripple, centered under cabinet base
- Background must remain FSN Game Center grid — do not add stars, clouds, fog, or a white glow box
- Keep everything consistent with FSN’s cyberpunk, minimalist design

🧠 Do NOT:
- Do not center the cabinet
- Do not add other UI elements, mascots, or tokens
- Do not mirror or distort text
- Do not redraw the Game Center header or nav
- Do not replace the background — use existing FSN background

Only render the **left arcade cabinet**. Right side must remain empty for future use.
