🧠 REPLIT AI INSTRUCTION SET: XP & LEVELING SYSTEM (PHASE 0)
Objective:
Enhance the Pulse Command Center by implementing a visual leveling system powered by XP, with animated level indicators and progressive XP thresholds.

🔧 Implementation Tasks
1. Level Calculation Logic
Create a leveling function that takes current XP and returns a level number.

Use a basic exponential progression:

Edit
Level 1 = 0–999 XP  
Level 2 = 1000–1999 XP  
Level 3 = 2000–3499 XP  
Level 4 = 3500–5499 XP  
Level 5 = 5500–7999 XP  
Level 6 = 8000–10999 XP  
...continue scaling as needed
Store the user’s level as a computed property (not static), based on total XP.

2. XP Ring UI Element
On the Pulse Command Center panel (next to "Current Pulse" and "Status"), add a circular XP progress ring:

Outer glow ring fills proportionally to XP progress in current level.

Center shows:

Use Orbitron font and FSN neon styles (cyan glow, bold font).

Animate the ring on XP gain (use a subtle charge-up effect).

3. Microanimations + Feedback
When XP is gained (e.g. “+50 XP”), trigger:

XP number floats up and fades from the action (already partially working)

Pulse ring flashes briefly with neon ripple effect

If level is increased:

Show “Level Up!” animation overlay near ring

Add optional 🎉 emoji burst or pulse shockwave glow

4. Top Right XP Display Enhancement
Modify the existing XP indicator in the top-right nav:

Change 865 XP to:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
Lvl 3 • 865 XP
Hover tooltip: “Next level at 1000 XP”

5. Pulse History Integration (Optional)
In the Pulse Activity History modal, next to each XP gain, display a level badge (if level changed after that event)

E.g.
+60 XP → Lvl 2

🖼️ Visual Style & Branding Notes
Font: Orbitron (or consistent FSN font used site-wide)

Color:

XP numbers: Electric Cyan (#00FFFF)

Level Up Glow: Neon Purple or Gradient Blue Glow

All animations should follow existing FSN visual language (e.g. glow trails, sci-fi gradients, minimal but fluid).
