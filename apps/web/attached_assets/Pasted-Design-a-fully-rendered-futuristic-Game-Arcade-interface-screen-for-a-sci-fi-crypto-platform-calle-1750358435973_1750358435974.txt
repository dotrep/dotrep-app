Design a fully-rendered futuristic “Game Arcade” interface screen for a sci-fi crypto platform called FSN. Use an aesthetic inspired by TRON and Zaxxon: deep space background, glowing blue neon, angled 3D elements, floating light particles, and visual symmetry. Every object must feel lit, dimensional, and radiant.

View: Isometric 3/4 perspective — viewer is looking slightly **downward and from the front-right**. All objects must be angled accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------
🌌 1. BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------
- Dark cosmic background with:
  - Glowing star map/constellation effect (network of faint glowing nodes and lines)
  - Misty, subtle moving particle clouds
  - Faint gradient radial light from center behind mascot
  - Ground plane: black reflective base with glints, particle shimmer, and floor glow rings under machines

------------------------------------------------------
🧠 2. TOP HEADER
------------------------------------------------------
- FSN logo centered at top with electric blue glow and soft bloom
- Below logo: Large glowing text “GAME ARCADE”
  - Font: futuristic sans-serif, wide letter spacing, all caps
  - Color: neon blue with outer glow and slight inner light

Behind this header, add faint flickering vertical light beams or signal trails for ambient motion

------------------------------------------------------
🕹 3. LEFT ARCADE MACHINE — “DAILY QUEST”
------------------------------------------------------
A glowing 1980s-style arcade cabinet, drawn in perfect 3/4 isometric view from above, **facing slightly rightward toward the center mascot**.

📐 Geometry:
- Overall shape: Tall **trapezoidal wedge** (classic arcade shape) — front is wider at base, tapers slightly at top
- Side: Slightly angled back wall, visible to the viewer
- Screen: Black inset display, tilted backward, not vertical. Emits a blue glow
- Control panel: Slanted surface below the screen with:
  - 2–3 round glowing blue buttons
  - 1 short joystick
- Top marquee: Glowing horizontal banner labeled **“DAILY QUEST”**, protruding slightly forward at the top
- Base: Sits on a **glowing circular floor ring** (neon blue), with blue mist particles rising around it

🧪 FX:
- All edges emit electric blue glow
- Subtle inner shadows and lighting gradients for depth
- Glowing seams on the sides

------------------------------------------------------
🧬 4. CENTER MASCOT + SIGNAL POINTS
------------------------------------------------------
At center of the page, draw the FSN mascot as a glowing, happy drop-shaped character, standing upright, facing forward.

📐 Geometry:
- Body: Round teardrop form with slight limb suggestions
- Face: Glowing smile, wide glowing white eyes
- Arms: Outstretched in joy (wings or arms raised)
- Aura: Surrounded by:
  - Soft blue radiating glow
  - Floating particles
  - Shimmer trails or sparkles

🧾 Text elements:
- Above: **“+12 SIGNAL POINTS!”** — bold glowing text in electric blue
- Below: **“New Quest in…”** — smaller glowing caption

The mascot should be the **visual focal point** and scaled to match the arcade machines flanking it

------------------------------------------------------
🕹 5. RIGHT ARCADE MACHINE — “MINI MISSIONS”
------------------------------------------------------
Same design and orientation as left machine, but **mirrored to face leftward toward the mascot**.

📐 Geometry:
- Trapezoidal wedge shape, angled properly
- Label: **“MINI MISSIONS”** on the top glowing banner
- Screen: Glowing **star icon** on dark background
- Control panel: Buttons and joystick as on left side
- Base: Blue floor ring with mist effects

🎯 Important: This cabinet must be **geometrically symmetrical** with the left one — identical size, lighting, glow intensity, and 3D taper

------------------------------------------------------
🧩 6. BOTTOM SECTION — GAME MODE CARDS
------------------------------------------------------
Create 3 glowing, floating info panels lined up at the bottom of the page. These are interactive buttons to start game modes.

📐 Geometry:
- Rectangular floating panels with rounded corners
- Each card has a glowing neon outline, soft inner shadow, and light bloom

🧾 Panel contents:
- Title (e.g., “QUEST CHALLENGES”, “CRYPTO PUZZLES”, “NETWORK WARS”)
- Icon near the top (glowing puzzle piece, star, or battle shield)
- 1–2 lines of short placeholder description
- Button at bottom: glowing blue outline with hoverable feel (text: “ENTER QUESTS” or “START NOW”)

🧪 FX:
- Each card should have a floating, backlit glow
- Use light particle flickers above or around them
- Maintain equal spacing and alignment

------------------------------------------------------
🎨 COLOR + LIGHTING STYLE GUIDE
------------------------------------------------------
- Primary color: Electric blue
- Accents: Cyan, deep black, white-hot highlights
- All major shapes must cast glow (outer + inner glow)
- Use shading and gradients for 3D volume (no flat vectors)
- All geometry should follow isometric 3/4 perspective from above
- Maintain symmetry between left/right arcade machines
- Avoid clutter: composition must be clean, centered, and heroic

------------------------------------------------------
🔐 BRAND AESTHETIC REFERENCE
------------------------------------------------------
