# Deployment Status

## Current Status: Development Mode

### Issue
Contract deployment to Base Sepolia is failing due to bytecode compilation errors. The ethers.js library is rejecting the provided bytecode as "invalid BytesLike value".

### Deployment Attempts
1. **Hardhat Deployment**: Failed due to RPC URL configuration issues
2. **Direct Ethers Deployment**: Failed due to invalid bytecode format
3. **Minimal Contract**: Still failing with bytecode validation errors

### Current Solution
The frontend is configured with:
- Mock contract address: `0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555`
- Simulated name availability checking
- Mock registration process with 2-second delay to simulate blockchain transaction

### Next Steps for Production
1. **Fix Bytecode**: Need properly compiled Solidity contract bytecode
2. **Deploy Contract**: Successfully deploy to Base Sepolia testnet
3. **Update Frontend**: Replace mock address with real contract address
4. **Test Integration**: Verify end-to-end name registration flow

### Environment
- **Network**: Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532)
- **RPC URL**: https://sepolia.base.org
- **Deployer Balance**: 0.089 ETH (sufficient for deployment)
- **Deployer Address**: 0xCdD9dDe3925654Ecaa01B970Ca5c94fb8413DfCA

### Frontend Integration Status
✅ Wallet connection working
✅ Name availability checking (mock)
✅ Registration flow UI complete
✅ Toast notifications working
✅ Wagmi v2 integration complete
❌ Actual blockchain contract deployment
❌ Real contract interactions

The system is ready for testing with the mock contract and will work seamlessly once the real contract is deployed.
