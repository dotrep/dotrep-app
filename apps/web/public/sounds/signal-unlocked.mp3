# This is a placeholder text file for the signal unlock sound effect
# To complete the implementation, replace this text file with an actual .mp3 audio file
# The audio should be a short (1-3 second) futuristic/sci-fi notification sound
# Some suggested sounds:
# - Rising electronic tone with reverb
# - Sci-fi computer beep/chirp
# - Soft synthesizer pulse
# - Metallic "unlock" chime

# For testing purposes, the SignalUnlockModal will attempt to play this file
# but will gracefully handle the error if no audio file is present
